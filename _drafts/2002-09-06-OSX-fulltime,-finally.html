<p>Been spending most of this week finally upgrading to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>.  Been a long wait since I first tried out the Public Beta, but worth it.  Even seems to run OK on my G3 imac.  Had to spend enough to upgrade this to get OSX on it: another hardrive to back-up, more memory and then Jaguar itself.  Would love a <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">G4 imac</a> though.</p><p>So now I&apos;ve finished upgrading I can get back to filling in all the blanks on this site.</p>
