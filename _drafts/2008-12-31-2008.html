<p>The typical &#34;Year in Review&#34; post.</p><p>Finally getting another <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_motofone_f3-1794.php">mobile phone</a>, 4 years after the <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_k700-692.php">last one</a> I got. I&#39;ve been without a functioning mobile for a couple of years now. Amazingly it&#39;s more basic than the <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_t18s-116.php">first ever mobile</a> I had, but I like it. Also, <a href="http://www.asdamobile.com/">Asda Mobile</a> is fantastic value.</p><p>My first full year of photography. I hope I manage to get some shots next year that I like as much as the ones this year. I&#39;m very glad I decided to get a camera. And then decided to get more cameras. Here&#39;s to yet more next year.</p><p>The highland games we&#39;ve attended: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/sets/72157607153108512/">Keith Country Show</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/sets/72157607153712194/">Lonach Gathering</a>. These were really good. And it&#39;s been nice to actually live up here and enjoy what&#39;s on offer, rather than just exist like we did in Lancaster.</p><p>Work: enforced job change after being assimilated by the borGE. Could have gone a lot worse, so it&#39;s positive from that point of view.</p><p>Developing my first <a href="http://shoooes.net/">Shoes</a> app at work. A little thing, but gave me a big sense of achievement. Shame it&#39;s nothing to do with my actual role at work, but still.</p><p>Finally updating this site to <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/12/7/rails-2-0-it-s-done">Rails 2</a>, etc. Only a year late. Again a little thing, but I was amazed I didn&#39;t have to bail and go back to the old one.</p><p>Going to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/sets/72157608177287079/">Poland</a>. Because travelling is rare. And it&#39;s good to explore. And <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/2953924425/in/set-72157608177287079/">learn</a> at least a little.</p><p>126 film cartridges become unavailable in the UK.</p><p>Not exploring as much of Scotland as I hoped. Apart from the shows we&#39;ve not got very far. I was hoping to get further up north over the summer. But it&#39;s been and gone. Summer was a bit pants really. Not a lot happened.</p><p>Only making one <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/sets/72157603874194024/">flickr meet</a>. In January! The year got off to a good start with that and I was hopeful that I might actually get to know some people up here and make some real-life/3D friends instead of the real-but-virtual ones I have. In three years in Lancaster I got to know the sum total of zero people. Pretty depressing. Unfortunately it looks like Aberdeen is going to be the same. Such is family life it seems.</p><p>Not having a holiday. I don&#39;t mean an abroad one, or even camping in the UK, but just not really having a break. Until now: Christmas. It&#39;s been a tiring year.</p><p>Work: I still have no idea what I want to do. I wonder if I ever will?</p>
