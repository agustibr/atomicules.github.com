<p>Skating <em>was</em> part of my life since I was about 12 till I was about 26. So at that point is was at least half of my life skating;  mainly on, sometimes off like my busy times at uni and my busy times at work and the shite winters that were Huddersfield.  I&apos;m sad to say that it is no more now. My final moment was the completion of the <a href="http://www.fieldlife.co.uk" >Fieldlife video</a>. Somewhere in these posts it might mention a huge backlog of video editing to do, well it did finally get done and that DVD is the result</p>

<p>So it&apos;s a shame. I had fun times. But since I&apos;m now old, married and boring I don&apos;t skate anymore. Just have the memories. There is unlikely to be much posted under this heading anymore</p>
