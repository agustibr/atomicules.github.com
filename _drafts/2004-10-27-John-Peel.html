<p>I&apos;m surprised at just how upset I was to hear about the death of John

Peel. I felt/feel gutted. Maddness. The memories I have include many of

travelling late at night listening to John Peel, sometimes flicking to

something else cus his eclectic taste wasn&apos;t necessarily mine (nevermind

damn right confusing if you&apos;d just tuned in sometimes to hear something

bizarre "This isn&apos;t Radio1 is it?!"). Also I remember taping an entire

Festive 50 one christmas and listening to it all through the next year. It&apos;s

a sad loss. I hope I can get to Glastonbury next year, but I think it&apos;ll be

more popular than ever.</p>

<p>It&apos;s tempting sometimes (especially for me) to dismiss muso types, along

with the arty farty masses as a bit worthless and not really contributing to

society. This is bred from pure jealously from spending my time working far

too hard doing engineering with the impending realisation that I was the one

who was wasting my life, not them. Yeah, so John did something he loved, he

didn&apos;t put out fires, build bridges, make the ill better or anything

tangible. Although he certainly led to bands prospering. But there is

something else as well. Many of the &apos;grey&apos; world like me do owe a lot to

John and his ilk. I know I wouldn&apos;t/couldn&apos;t have done my GCSEs, A-Levels or

degree (and often some days at work) without listening to music. So

thank-you, goodbye, you&apos;ll be missed.</p>
