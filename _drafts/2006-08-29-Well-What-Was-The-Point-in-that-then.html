Articles like this: <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/tohellwithwcag2/" > To Hell with WCAG 2</a> and this: <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/08/23/overton-window" >W3C and the Overton window</a> (which is where I found the first link) scare me a bit. I get the impression that a lot of the Web Standard gurus are leaving the <a href="http://www.w3.org" >W3C</a> after disagreements, etc and there seem to be emerging &apos;competitors&apos; to W3C such as <a href="http://microformats.org/" >Microformats</a> as a result.</p>

<p>But where does this leave the plebs like me, who don&apos;t understand the finer points that people are disagreeing on, or indeed care to understand those disagreements, but would at least like to do their little bit in trying to produce a site to some kind of standard?

</p>

<p>Are we just screwed? If the big guns aren&apos;t behind a standard, then to me it&apos;s no longer a standard (or even a recommendation, which is what it really is anyway). Who are we to look to or follow? Personally, I&apos;d prefer it if people didn&apos;t abandon things over disagreements, but instead stick at it and get it right at the next revision, etc. Perhaps these folk are a little to use to the Open Source lifestyle where at first sign of disagreement it seems you fork off (f**k off!) into your own thing. That&apos;s great for creativity and choice, but shite for standards where you don&apos;t want as much choice (leads to confusion and mistakes) or creativity (tried and tested wins the game).</p>
