<p>Download: <a href="%base_url%downloads/OnlyAlbums.zip">OnlyAlbums - Applescript for iTunes</a></p>

<p><strong>What it does:</strong>This script will attempt to compile a playlist of only albums from the full iTunes music library, based on user inputted values for min. number of tracks per album and min. album duration</p>

<p>This started off after a post by siMac on the <a href="http://forums.macnn.com">Macnn forums</a>. I'd always fancied having this script anyway, so thought I'd have a go. As you can see from the thread: <a href="http://forums.macnn.com/showthread.php?t=273932">iTunes: Create playlist containing only albums?</a>, it wasn't successful for the user although it did work for me. You can also see an alternative version of the script developed by TETENAL in that same post</p>

<p>I then stumbled across a post by siMac on the <a href="http://forums.ipodlounge.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=62">iPodLounge Forums</a>. The moderator there, deeg,  points out <a href="http://forums.ipodlounge.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=125716">some possible improvements to me script</a>. I've not done them since &quot;It works for me&quot;, but you might want to bear them in mind</p>
