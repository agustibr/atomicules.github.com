Finally! Although it seems not completely. I seem to remember reading that the old iTunes store was something to do with being Quicktime based, but that could be a load of rubbish. I guess iTunes was around awhile before Webkit was even a twinkle, and of course iTunes became quite entrenched on Windows and Linux so switching probably wasn't that straight forward.
