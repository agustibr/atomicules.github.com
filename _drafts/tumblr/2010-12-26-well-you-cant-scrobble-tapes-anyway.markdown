Last.fm seems to have decided to stop scrobbling anything for me, probably something to do with the knackered battery in my iPod Mini, but since the last post I've been listening to these (honest, guv):

* Gold Panda - Lucky Shiner. This is much, much better on the second listen. Liking it a lot more now. The first time round I was a bit disppointed and couldn't see what the fuss was all about. But I don't think I was really paying attention. You (first track; confusingly the last track has same title but is different?!) is especially good.

* Warpaint  - The Fool. Ermm..? Kind of reminds me of Throwing Muses in bits, but with daintier vocals, interestingly enough. Track 7, Baby would be nice for drifitng off to sleep to. Otherwise, not sure. Needs more listens perhaps. 

* Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly - The missus likes it. 

* Belle and Sebestian - Write About Love. Completely and utterly worth it solely for I Want the World to Stop - hey that would make a great funeral track (I should remember these songs, and put them in my will, because otherwise I'll forget; like that song from the Dropkick Murphys that I thought would make a great funeral track about 10 years ago and I can't remember which one now). Anyway, yes, sorry, great album just because of that song, but others good too.  

and reliving some old favourites:

* Throwing Muses - Hunkpapa (wow Devils Roof, Dizzy) and Red Heaven (Furious!). Just great stuff. I remembered it from years ago. Reminds me of being in sixth form at school and I'd probably not listened to it in anger since about then, seeing as how it was on tape. But it is odd how I could just remember the opening to Furious, well not just remember but hear it as clear as day in my head. Good times. 

* Pop Will Eat Itself - At Weird's Bar and Grill. From the same time in my life as Throwing Muses. I remember the first time I listened to this (many years ago) I was disappointed. PWEI definitely had a different live sound to their studio sound. More raw, rough, etc. But after aout the second listen I was hooked and god knows how many times I listened to this (I've still got it on tape). I soon preferred the live sound. This was awesome then and is still awesome now.
