I took this last summer whilst out for a bike ride, but it was on Kodachrome so it took awhile to come back and then the slides just sat in my wardrobe until I had the cash to send them off for scanning. So eight months later I'm trying to remember where the hell I took this. All I can say is "Who needs GPS when there's [Google Street View](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=udny+station&sll=57.266978,-2.099762&sspn=0.011649,0.024848&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Udny+Station,+Ellon,+Aberdeenshire,+United+Kingdom&ll=57.295452,-2.095771&spn=0.005866,0.012424&t=h&z=16&layer=c&cbll=57.295239,-2.096237&panoid=GOaXKaYjoVqQD_b2K57m0g&cbp=12,94.05,,0,3.29)"
