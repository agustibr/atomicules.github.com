A quick test from the new app - native editing - Woohoo!

[edit] _And_  it does Markdown.

[edit 2] Not so happy - seems to want to tweet my posts even when I've got that preference turn off. Spammy.  

[edit 3] Have removed all Twitter settings from Tumblr account, that seems to have solved the problem for now.
