Worthy of a look: The photos are amazing. 

I'm pretty sure I've read about this process before although I can't recall the photos. Basically three photos of the same scene are taken in monochrome, but through different coloured filters. This then allows the colour of the scene to be recreated. However, since all three images are taken in series by one camera it required evryone to stand very still!
