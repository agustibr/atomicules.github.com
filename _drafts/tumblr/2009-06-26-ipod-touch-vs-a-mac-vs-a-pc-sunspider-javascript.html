<p><b>1st Place</b> My new main computing platform: iPod Touch 2nd Gen, OS 3.0:</p>&#13;
<p>Safari 33796.0ms +/- 3.1%</p>&#13;
<p><b>2nd Place</b> My stalwart: 12" Powerboook 1GHz PPC, OS X 10.5.7</p>&#13;
<p>Opera 9.62, 38896.8ms +/- 6.6%</p>&#13;
<p><b>3rd Place</b> At work: Dell D610, 2GHz Pentium, XP SP2</p>&#13;
<p>IE6* 49827.4ms +/- 4.6%</p>&#13;
<p>OK, those are chosen for shock value, but still that's pretty impressive.  For a 'fairer' comparison I have <a href="http://www.appletalker.net/forum/index.php?req=thread&amp;id=1528">more benchmarked</a>, such as Safari and Chrome on the PC, and Safari on the Mac. It does go to show though that iPod Touches and iPhones are a fairly respectable mobile computing platforms - who needs a netbook, hey?!</p>&#13;
<p>* IE6 remains my employers preferred  and default installed browser; It is still necessary for certain intranet sites that will not work with other browsers.</p>
