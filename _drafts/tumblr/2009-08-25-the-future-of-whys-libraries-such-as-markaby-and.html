<blockquote>With the sudden disappearance of _why, some popular libraries as Markaby, Hpricot and others are orphaned. We look at the effort to find maintainers for some, and at replacements for other librariesâ€¦.</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Although <a href="http://nokogiri.rubyforge.org/nokogiri/">Nokogiri</a> might seem like a drop in replacement for <a href="http://github.com/whymirror/hpricot/tree/master">Hpricot</a>, I'm not sure how easy that will be in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/shoooes">Shoes</a> which has Hpricot built in. If no one maintains Hpricot, then it would make sense to switch Shoes to Nokogiri, but it might end up being easier to get someone to maintain Hpricot! Will have to ask this on the Shoes mailing list.</p>
