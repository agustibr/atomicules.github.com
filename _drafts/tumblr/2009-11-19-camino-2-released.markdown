I've been using Camino for a long time, since before it was called Camino, back in the days of Jaguar.

Camino is like a good wine. It develops slowly, but the end result is stellar. It is 'the' Gecko browser on my mac. I much prefer it over Firefox.

Recently I have become a fan of Webkit (especially with it's speed, features and rapid pace of development) and use the nightlies, but I long for a UI as polished as Camino.
