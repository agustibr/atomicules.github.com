So something is enabled by default that surprises many users? That doesn't strike me as good interface design. Anyway, thanks to a bit of googling and [this forum post](http://www.velocityreviews.com/forums/showpost.php?p=582247&postcount=10) I figured it out. 

I've only got a simple Java app and really didn't want to have to install Netbeans or Eclipse just to generate a Class Diagram, so I'm glad I got [ArgoUML out](http://argouml.tigris.org/) figured.
