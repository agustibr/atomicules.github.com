<p>An indispensable VIM plugin if you are looking for an easy way to do find and replace on a number of files. I never really used Textmate, but BBEdit did do this quite well back when I used it, although from recollection not as cleanly as this. Â When doing a find it presents a list of matching files, complete with an excerpt of the result. Clicking on the entry in the results window opens it up in the pane above for editing, at the place where the excerpt is from. Just ace.</p>&#13;
<p>Also found today, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218">NERD Commenter</a> is quite handy (no where as near as handy as the above though) for commenting out lines and sections of code. It automatically does the correct commenting type based on the filetype.</p>&#13;
<p>I'll add both of these into my <a href="http://i-5-m.net/post/115035560/vim">earlier Vim post</a>.</p>
