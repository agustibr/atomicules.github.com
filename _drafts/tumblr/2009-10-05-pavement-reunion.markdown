Ok, so a bit behind with this post. But I just wanted a chance to say: I saw [Pavement back in 1995 at the Brixton Academy](http://ragemagazine.co.uk/ISSUE3/INDLIV03.PDF) (link to PDF review from [Rage magazine](http://ragemagazine.co.uk/)).

There you go. Done it.

As far as I can recall my ticket was courtesy of my friend (I wish more than just one of my old school friends maintined an online presence, Facebook excluded, so I could have a nosey on what they are up to now) who wanted someone to accompany him. I don't think I was that fussed for Pavement, but I did like Deus who were supporting and I think Blumfeld were quite good too. I lived a lot nearer London then than I do now of course. And I was probably a bit scared walking through Brixton.
