<p>It&apos;s so annoying to say <a href="/site/2006/08/25/Opening-doors-behind-the-scenes/">you&apos;ve done a load of changes</a> only to find out they aren&apos;t all there. For some reason I failed to commit my changes to my subversion repository (still learning) and had instead stopped my Google site search from working altogether, instead of making it more accessible. Fingers crossed I got it right this time</p>
