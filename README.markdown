My [blog](http://i5m.co.uk) hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/).

Points of interest:
* The [scripts](https://gist.github.com/881023) I used to migrate from Tumblr, Rails and Nanoblogger
* My use of Jekyll is Tumblr-inspired and I have different [post types](https://github.com/i5m/i5m.github.com/tree/master/_includes), video, photo, link, etc (audio and chat are the only two I've not figured out yet).
* My [archive page](https://github.com/i5m/i5m.github.com/blob/master/archive.html) is also Tumblr-inspired. It uses the Github provided Jekyll, no plugins, etc, just clever use of liquid markup to collate posts by month.
