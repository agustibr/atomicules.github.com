<p>It's like an "about" page, just called Elsewhere.</p>
<p>I've always liked making <strong>pictures</strong>. When I was a teenager it was with pens and pencils. Looking back at those pictures I wouldn't say I was particularly talented (at all!), but I did at least have the balls to have a go and not worry about what other people thought. Unfortunately I lost the way a bit at Uni and concentrated far too much on technical skills, never really worrying about my creative drawing ability and always assuming it was something I could pick right back up. By the time I realised that wasn't the case it was too late - my skills had gone downhill, but far worse after all that time apart my passion had waned. After Uni I had a ball making moving pictures. It was only for a couple of years, but I discovered I had a love for video editing. It was a hobby I couldn't afford to keep doing though and so after a couple of years in the wilderness I decided to switch to photography, realising that I could get a film SLR kit for Â£13 since everyone had gone digital. Turns out I love photography too and I sincerely thought this was a hobby I could afford and pursue for the foreseeable future. I still want that to be the case so much so that is aches.<p>
<p>Push, push, push. Skateboarding is something else I wasn't particularly good at, certainly struggled at, but had so much fun it didn't matter. Passion makes up for ability in droves. Skateboarding was a big-ish part of my life right from my pre-teenage years, up until a good few years after Uni (with the obligitary few wilderness years inbetween at Uni when I couldn't afford it) when being a grown-up and responsible family man stopped it dead. Such is life, just keep <strong>pushing</strong> on though. Which brings my to cycling, which although has always "been there", has only recently become a "thing"; we had to move house and I ended nineteen miles from work. When you are commutting that distance back and forth everyday, cycling quickly becomes a "thing".</p>
<p>This is the most recent one of all. I can't say I was geeky computer loving child. Yeah I had some Usborne <strong>programming</strong> books and would have attempted to do some programming on the old Plus 4, but I pretty much would have got frustrated and gone outside and done something else instead. With hindsight I wish I'd done this at Uni, although I didn't know I liked it at the time, so I can't blame myself too much. I have to say I completely regret studying what I did at Uni. It was a "makes sense on paper" decision, fuelled by not knowing what I wanted to do, but with a opportunity to seemingly combine all the things I did enjoy (maths, science and design) in a "sensible" career. If I'd just picked one of those things - any one - it would have probably turned out better.</p>
