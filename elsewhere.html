	<h2>Pictures</h2>
	<p>I've always liked making pictures. When I was a teenager it was with pens and pencils. Looking back at those pictures I wouldn't say I was particularly talented (at all!), but I did at least have the balls to have a go and not worry about what other people thought. Unfortunately I lost the way a bit at Uni and concentrated far too much on technical skills, never really worrying about my creative drawing ability and always assuming it was something I could pick right back up. By the time I realised that wasn't the case it was too late - my skills had gone downhill, but far worse after all that time apart my passion had waned. After Uni I had a ball making moving pictures. It was only for a couple of years, but I discovered I had a love for video editing. It was a hobby I couldn't afford to keep doing though and so after a couple of years in the wilderness I decided to switch to photography, realising that I could get a film SLR kit for Â£13 since everyone had gone digital. Turns out I love photography too and I sincerely thought this was a hobby I could afford and pursue for the foreseeable future. I still want that to be the case so much so that is aches.<p>
	<h2>Pushing</h2>
	<p>Push, push, push. Skateboarding is something else I wasn't particularly good at, certainly struggled at, but had so much fun it didn't matter. Passion makes up for ability in droves. Skateboarding was a big-ish part of my life right from my pre-teenage years, up until a good few years after Uni (with the obligatory few wilderness years inbetween at Uni when I couldn't afford it) when being a grown-up and responsible family man stopped it dead. Such is life. However, self propulsion was soon to pop up again, swapping two wheels for four. Cycling, which although has always "been there", has only recently become a "thing"; we had to move house and I ended up nineteen miles from work. When you are commuting that distance back and forth everyday, cycling quickly becomes a "thing".</p>
	<h2>Programming</h2>
	<p>I can't say I was geeky computer loving child, so this is a relatively newer thing for me. Yeah I had some Usborne programming books and would have attempted to do some programming on the old Plus 4, but I pretty much would have got frustrated and gone outside and done something else instead. But with hindsight I wish I'd done this at Uni, although I didn't know I liked it at the time, so I can't blame myself too much. I have to say I completely regret studying what I did at Uni. It was a "makes sense on paper" decision, fuelled by not knowing what I wanted to do, but with a opportunity to seemingly combine all the things I did enjoy (maths, science and design) in a "sensible" career. If I'd just picked one of those things - any one - it would have probably turned out better. Anyway, is that kind of relevant, or have I just gone off on a rant? I was going to say "one thing it did do, was lead me into programming", but I'm not overly sure it did. Anyway, again, yeah - programming.</p>
