<p>I've tweaked the (x)HTML and CSS so it gets as near to validating as it ever will. Tumblr use an iframe to insert the <img alt="Tumblr iFrame Follow image" src="http://assets.tumblr.com/images/iframe_follow_alpha.png" align="bottom" height="20" width="58" /> and <img alt="Tumblr iFrame Dashboard image" src="http://assets.tumblr.com/images/iframe_dashboard_alpha.png" align="bottom" height="20" width="81" />, etc into the top right hand corner of the page. This <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/tumblr/topics/iframe_for_tumblr_controls_breaks_xhtml_validation">throws a validation error</a>. There's nothing I can do about that. And it's of no big concern.</p>
<p>The CSS is valid apart from the use of border-radius. Which is more an issue with the Jigsaw validation engine than an actual error.</p>
<p>All, in all, I'm quite impressed that Tumblr allows you to get syntax this good. It's a shame you can't use the HTML5 doctype with Tumblr, but again, not the end of the world.</p>
<p>Although almost valid, the mark-up still requires a fair bit of work. It's all a bit of a hack and could benefit from some tidying up. I'll do that in the meantime.</p>
