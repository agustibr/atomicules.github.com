<p>Another week of none events.  Where does my time go and what do I achieve?</p>

<p>It&apos;s taken me a few weeks to figure out how to get DVDs authored correctly.  My geek dilemma is recounted on the <a href="http://forums.macnn.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=145733">macnn forums</a> (one of a couple of places I asked for help, as you can see I didn&apos;t get too many replies)</p>
