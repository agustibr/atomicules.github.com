<p><a href="http://www.haloscan.com" >Haloscan's</a> default setup for including comments is to use a javascript command in the href attribute, ie:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

&lt;a href="javascript:HaloScan('Name');" &gt;

</p>

</blockquote>

<p>However, this is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/newmedia/technical/javascript.shtml">a bit naughty and not nice</a>. It is better to include a real link in the href attribute and put javascript in an onClick attribute. That in itself is easy to do, but the problem I had with Nanoblogger was that I was using the post ID (NB_EntryID) as the Haloscan comment name since it would be unique for all posts. This is in the format "e2006-07-17T22_10_04.txt", but Haloscan reformats this on the fly to "e2006_07_17T22_10_04_txt", which is all well and good, but if I'm not using javascript in the href attribute it means I need to reformat the NB_EntryID upfront.</p>

<p>This had me puzzled for a bit, but Nanoblogger, being the cool thing that it is allows you to use Bash commands directly in the blog template files, which means I could put: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>

href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/i5m/`echo "$NB_EntryID" |sed -e 's/[^0-9eTtx]/_/g'`"

</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Which is just pretty cool. The bits between ` and ` get executed. I've not used sed before, but have used awk and regexp, etc, very briefly: the "s" stands for substitute, the [^0-9eTtx] matches any character that isn't a number, letter e, T, t or x. The underscore, "_" is what to replace the matches with and the "g" means replace all occurences.</p>
