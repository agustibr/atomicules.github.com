<p><i>- By <a href="http://bicycle.thebluesmokeband.com/wordpress/">Bricycle: Fun On Two Wheels</a> from <a href="http://bicycle.thebluesmokeband.com/wordpress/?p=70">How To Get Into Toe Clips On A Fixed Gear Bicycle</a></i></p>
<p>So a bit later than hoped for (although patience provided me with a 99p eBay bargain), I've got some toe clips for my bike. No more embarrassing moments forgetting I can't freewheel down hill and having to lift my legs up off the pedals. Nope, instead I'm swapping that for the embarrassment of not being able to get my feet into the toe clips in the first place.</p>
<p>I found the above advice quite useful though. You'd think it would be easier to get your foot in near the top of the stroke, but no it seems it's much easier to get it in at the bottom, what's more you can get it in on the first revolution (which is good because there's no chance of me flipping the pedal and getting my foot in at speed).</p>
<p>I did find though, that starting of with the opposite leading foot helped. I.e. without clips I'd naturally lead with my right leg, but it seems my left foot lacks co-ordination and there's no way I can get it in the clip. If I lead with my left foot I can get my right foot in before my left has done half a revolution (I do currently have to sneak a peak though).</p>
<p>Also, I now see the attraction of trackstands. Or not stopping at junctions, lights, etc. Think I'll have to learn trackstands.</p>
<p>Also, I thought I'd have to consciously 'use' the toe clips, i.e. make a point of pulling up on the up stroke, but you don't, you just pedal as normal and let the toe clips do the magic - I can only imagine how ace clipless must be - but imagine it will remain as it's 99p for brand new to clips vs at least £40 for someone's sweaty second hand SPD shoes and worn out pedals.</p>
