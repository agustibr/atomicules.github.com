I seem to have some kind of karma "ceiling" when it comes to cycling. Having been fortunate enough to receive some proper cycling overshoes from my dad for my birthday (I have long since wanted some, but they are rather expensive for my means so I've had to [make do with homemade ones]({{ site.baseurl }}2012/11/26/Making-do-mending-getting-by.html)) on the very first day of having them I lost one of my rear bike lights. Unfortunately it happened to be the better of the two I have. I cycled an extra eight miles retracing my route trying to find it to no avail.

For whatever reason I can't seem to have everything "just so", something always has to give. Oh well, the overshoes are great.
