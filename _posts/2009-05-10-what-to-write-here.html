<p>Interesting personal blogs are written about things the writer is passionate, knowledgeable and opinionated about.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the things you are emotive about aren't best served by blogging for every man and his dog to see. In the space of a few years things have changed a lot. I certainly won't be mentioning anything to do with work. I think the only bloggers that seem to get away with that nowadays are public sector professionals. Maybe because it's seen to be in the best interests of the public on some kind of level? Also, over the years my interests have changed; The main one being dropping video editing for photography.</p>
<p>So this time around, I think it'll be a bit of a art+code slant. Photography and (listening to) music making up the <i>art</i> side of things. And whatever geeky things I find myself doing for the <i>code</i> side of things.</p>
