This is a link to a link, which I almost detest doing, but in this case I feel the notes I've added to my Pinboard bookmark merit it. I've been trying to figure this out on and off now for a couple of weeks. Resizing the VirtualBox VDI was the easy bit, getting the Linux guest to recognise and use the increased "volume" was where I was struggling.
