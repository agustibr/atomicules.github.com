Forgot to put this under my year in review post. [My Last.fm chart](http://www.last.fm/user/i5m/charts) No.1s for the past 12 months (so roughly 2009).

* Top Artist: Freestylers 
* Top Album: Ladyhawke - Ladyhawke 
* Top Song: Magic - Ladyhawke

Ladyhawke is a good album. So many good tracks. [I said that]({{ site.baseurl }}2009/06/02/right-lets-try-out-some-reblogging-and-then.html) at the time. Freestylers are still way ahead and I suspect it will stay that way for a while. There is nothing else I enjoy listening to more than the Freestylers. It's just not getting old for me.
