I meant to make a quick post about the status of my photography a bit sooner than this. I had hoped this year was the turn around year and that I'd done my bit and I'd be able to pick it back up. It was looking promising when I finally managed to shift some of the [back](http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/sets/72157631595566914/)[log](http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/sets/72157629646923030/).

I am entirely optimistic. This came as a much of a shock to me as I am sure it will to others. However, realistically it's now been stalled for well over two years. I've looked into whether I can do it any cheaper than I already do/did:

- Looked into [cheap diy development](http://www.caffenol.org): Not actually [that](http://www.flickr.com/groups/33051635@N00/discuss/72157626859267089/) [cheap](http://www.apug.org/forums/viewpost.php?p=1230514) 
- Looked into [making own film](http://www.costaricacoffeeart.com/alternative_photography_make_your_own_negative_film_or_plates.php): [Not actually any cheaper than a cheap roll of film](http://costaricacoffeeart.com/photo_emulsion_how_to_make_it_yourself.php).

Basically I can't really do it any cheaper than I already do. Especially given the odd development (pun unavoidable) of an [increasing number](http://www.photo-express.co.uk/films-to-cd.php) of [great value](http://www.photofilmprocessing.co.uk/35mmfilm.html) [process and scan](http://www.ag-photolab.co.uk/c41-process-only-35mm120220110-463-p.asp) options in the UK. Spoilt for choice.

I shall just wait patiently. AGAIN.
