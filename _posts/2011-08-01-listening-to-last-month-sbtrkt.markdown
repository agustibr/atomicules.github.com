Some how never got around to mentioning this last month (How is it August already?!). Anyway, [SBTRKT - SBTRKT](http://theyoungturks.co.uk/sbtrkt-sbtrkt/) was the album of the month that month by virtue of it being the only new thing I listened to that month. And Pharoahs is definitely the highlight of the album. Way better than the other tracks.

Don't think this is actually a video, just the audio. They should make a video though.
