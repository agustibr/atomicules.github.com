The last of my recent resurgence in uploads. I've now just got four films left to get developed from the two-year hiatus and then one film that's about a year and half old and one that is fairly recent. And *then* I can start shooting afresh.

This was put together in Aperture before my recent decision to stop using Aperture (or any local editing tools). Some fluky manual lens film shooting coupled with a bit of colour balancing in aperture to make it look just so.
