<p><b>Flickr Short URLs</b> have been around for a little while, but I still don't think they've been officially announced. At least I've not notice a post on the main <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en">flickr blog</a>, or the <a href="http://code.flickr.net/">flickr code blog</a>.</p>
<p>I first saw them on Twitter as a flickr staff member had used one. I googled and found this blog entry on <a href="http://www.garibion.com/2009/04/flickr-short-url.html">flickr short urls</a>.</p>
<p>So this is just to spread the word. At the moment you have to view source on the photo page and look for:</p>
<pre id="line23">&lt;link rev="canonical" type="text/html" href="http://flic.kr/p/xxxxxx" &gt;<br /></pre>
<p>But this then gives you a permanent short url that isn't going to expire and you also know where you are being taken to. I imagine when they officially announce it they'll add it into the Share This bit on each photo's page.</p>
