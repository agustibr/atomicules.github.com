<p>Small achievements in life are what please me, even if no one else cares.  But, finally <a href="/archive/">my archives</a> are now formatted properly.  It shouldn't have been hard considering <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> post all the <a href="http://publicmind.blogger.com/enduser/group.jsp?node=161">help</a> you need, and this evening, probably about my fifth time of reading the same help page, it finally clicked and I've got the <a href="http://www.bignosebird.com/ssi.shtml">SSI</a> queries working,  ace, now people can read all the shit I wrote a <a href="/archive/">few days ago.</a> </p>

<p>Next I really need to move from <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> to<a href="http://www.moveabletype.org"> moveable type</a>.  Hell if I was really clever I could run this off my machine.  But that would likely take me years to achieve.</p>

<p>Now that most of the Barca story is there, I really need to get my arse in gear and edit some video. Lazy lazy lazy.</p>
