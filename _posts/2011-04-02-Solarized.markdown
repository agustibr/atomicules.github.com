Very polished and well presented colour-scheme for Vim (and more). Using it now. Couldn't get it to work with Pathogen though (not investigated why, jusy installed in normally). Also, whilst I was taking a peek around the website, noticed it used [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a Haskell static site generator inspired by Jekyll - very interesting (I need to get back to learning Haskell).
