title: A Poor Little Kitten has Lost its Mittens

Well, perhaps not a kitten, maybe a lion since these mittens are about as big as oven glove mitts. Yes, finally after two and a bit winters of having to cope with freezing hands and ineffective layering of individually ineffective gloves, I've been able to splash out a whole Â£15 (including P&P!) on some [German Army Issue Mittens](http://www.amazon.co.uk/GERMAN-ARMY-ISSUE-GORETEX-LINER/dp/B0041L0YIC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1353235566&sr=8-1). That's far more in my price range than any of [the](http://www.sealskinz.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=2&products_id=43) [other](http://www.blazewear.com/heated-gloves/powermax-sports-glove-6.html) [options](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/craft-thermal-split-finger-bike-gloves/). So far, so good, although I haven't had any properly cold weather (minus double-digit degrees Celcius - it's only been minus a few degrees) yet to know if they'll really work as I hope: being super huge there is plenty of scope for wearing insulated gloves under them, using layers of newspaper around my fingers or actually sticking hand warmers inside them; My fingers are on the skeletal side of things (no fat, look dead at the best of times) so I suspect my glove insulation requirements are greater than most people. If I was just wearing them on their own and not for cycling then a medium size would have been a better fit, but the large size also has the advantage that the thumbs are plenty long enough for cycling. It's too early to tell on the dryness front: they've been in 19 miles of light rain, but not heavy rain yet - however, I'd be very surprised if they are worse than my supposedly waterproof gloves (they only way I can make those actually waterpoof is by [wearing marigolds under them]({{ site.baseurl}}2012/04/30/marigolds-and-carrier-bags.html)).

And, yes, as I expected I can change gears with them, it's just a bit fiddly, especially given their size - but I'll happily take fiddly over cold fingers.
