I live by the "It's Cool to be Crap" motto (from [R.A.D. magazine](http://www.whenwewasrad.co.uk/) for those that can remember). So to go with my [crap Haskell attempt]({{ site.baseurl }}2011/04/12/Selection-Sort-in-Haskell.html) here's my 2nd crap attempt at a [Pinboard to Camino bookmark importer]({{ site.baseurl }}2011/02/22/pinboard-bookmark-importer-for-camino.html), one that preserves Camino metadata (such as number of visits) rather than simply deleting and replacing all the bookmarks. I still have a long way to go, but I am on the right track (well I think I am).

# Pinboard to Camino
#
# A Ruby script to import/update Pinboard bookmarks into Camino
# This is a evolution of this Applescript: https://gist.github.com/835932 which simply deleted and 
# replaced a bookmarks collection. This Ruby script attempts to update, rather than delete and replace,
# so Camino bookmark visit counts are preserved, etc.
#
# IT IS VERY SLOW!
#
# Really, it is. Took about 35 mins to run through a Camino bookmarks file with 2003 existing "pinboard"
# bookmarks and add a further 1159 new "pinboard" bookmarks. 
# The reason why it is so slow is that it takes a full export from Pinboard and for each bookmark
# has to check every node in the Camino bookmarks file until it finds / doesn't find a match.
#
# This script "just about works for me", but is rubbish (may create duplicates).
# I'm just using this as a stepping stone to the next script where I will attempt
# to speed things up:
# - Create a hash of the two bookmark files for faster lookup
# - Search based on a MD5 of the urls, rather than the url itself, since this is what the API uses...
# - Consider using API to fetch 'changes' rather than 'everything'

This is as slow as chuff! Took about 35 mins to add a 1000 odd new bookmarks to my existing 2000 odd Camino bookmarks because it has to iterate through each node of the Camino bookmarks file for each bookmark exported from Pinboard.in. And I think it might have added some duplicates as well because I found out that Hpricot doesn't like finding URLs with additional colons in them, so will have failed to find the existing bookmark and added it again. 

The reason I stuck with this approach (iterating through each node) is that I can modify the Camino bookmarks structure on the fly. 
Now I've got this working I intend to speed it up by building a hash of the two bookmark files (which will make lookups and comparisons much easier, but complicates modifying the actual bookmark structure), make it more robust by using MD5s of URLs for searching and comparison and perhaps also looking into some Pinboard API options rather than doing a simple export of all bookmarks. But don't hold your breath...
