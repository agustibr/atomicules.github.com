As a result you do not force Rip on anyone else and individuals are free to re-package your code using other systems...Currently it's UNIX-only."

<p>It does sound interesting, I was hoping that it would be a full fledged alternative to Rubygems, because as good as Rubygems is, you do come into all kinds of issues with it: using behind proxy servers and making gems portable for using in apps (that damn 'require' statement) are two I can think of.</p>
<p>Alas, it seems <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/06/rip">the goals of RIP are slightly different from Ruby Gems</a>. But definitely one to watch.</p>
