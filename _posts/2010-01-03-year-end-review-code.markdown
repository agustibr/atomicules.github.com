Like photography, I've ended the year better skilled than I started it. Which feels good. But in both subjects I'd still consider myself a beginner (or always in Beta!)

## Highlights:

Much of the coding I do are little side projects at work, so can't go into details, but:
 
* I've got better at Ruby. I still stop when I get to modules, classes, etc - I could (and have) figure(d) it out, but I haven't had a real need yet (keep it simple and all that). Since I've mainly been using Shoes, and quick and dirty coding is fine there. 
* Javascript and user scripting for Chrome. The interesting thing here is I moved beyond moaning and bug reporting about the intranet not working fully in anything else but IE6 and started using userscripting to actually fix stuff.   
* Starting with Java. Not finding it as easy as Ruby, but it's certainly easier porting a concept from one language to another rather than starting completely from scratch. Looking to do a Jabber chat bot so a nice small enough project to learn on.
* Oracle SQL. I'd done a tiny bit of MySQL before, but got the chance to write a query for an Oracle SQL database. Easier enough once I twigged the differences.  

Using Shoes at work has also lead me to look at the Shoes source code:

* Figured out [building Shoes on OSX PPC](http://groups.google.com/group/shoooes/msg/98cbd6838fe757e9?) and updated the [build instructions](http://wiki.github.com/shoes/shoes/buildingshoesonosxppc).

* Updated [build instructions for windows](http://wiki.github.com/shoes/shoes/buildingshoeswithwindowswdk)

[ashbb](http://vgoff.blogspot.com/) actually did all the leg work here in actually [fixing Shoes for Windows](http://github.com/ashbb/shoes_hack_note), but just trying to follow his work has been an achievement for me. 

* Even managed to dabble in a bit of C in modifying Shoes to provide [Key up](http://github.com/i5m/shoes/commit/0cf7ec09bbfb4d3524f8de5a882ca7801000d67a) and [down](http://github.com/i5m/shoes/commit/1a95aab2be9062c9a3242c7f4f8892735dfd04c3) on Windows. I was, of course, subsequently [totally eclipsed by ashbb](http://github.com/ashbb/shoes/commit/5e17fc9307526f7ac61071f45776594fed2ed648), but I had a go, and that's the main thing. And the thrill of editing C code (never been near C before), compiling and actually managing to improve the functionality of a programme, was ace.   

## Next year plans:

All coding I do is work based - it's the only place I have time - just going to continue with the above. Hopefully be able to help out more with Shoes.
