<p>I'm surprised at just how upset I was to hear about the death of John

Peel. I felt/feel gutted. Maddness. The memories I have include many of

travelling late at night listening to John Peel, sometimes flicking to

something else cus his eclectic taste wasn't necessarily mine (nevermind

damn right confusing if you'd just tuned in sometimes to hear something

bizarre "This isn't Radio1 is it?!"). Also I remember taping an entire

Festive 50 one christmas and listening to it all through the next year. It's

a sad loss. I hope I can get to Glastonbury next year, but I think it'll be

more popular than ever.</p>

<p>It's tempting sometimes (especially for me) to dismiss muso types, along

with the arty farty masses as a bit worthless and not really contributing to

society. This is bred from pure jealously from spending my time working far

too hard doing engineering with the impending realisation that I was the one

who was wasting my life, not them. Yeah, so John did something he loved, he

didn't put out fires, build bridges, make the ill better or anything

tangible. Although he certainly led to bands prospering. But there is

something else as well. Many of the 'grey'; world like me do owe a lot to

John and his ilk. I know I wouldn't/couldn't have done my GCSEs, A-Levels or

degree (and often some days at work) without listening to music. So

thank-you, goodbye, you'll be missed.</p>
