I'm in limbo at the moment in a Text Editor of choice. I've been using <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">BBEdit</a> for a pretty long time and was pretty happy with it. But then I hit a <a href="http://www.appletalker.com/forum/index.php?req=thread&amp;postid=4610">bug in version 8</a> that's only going to be fixed in a future point release of the current 8.5 version (really a 9.0). Unfortunately for me, version 8.5 has also removed a feature that I came to rely on, so there is no point me upgrading.

<a href="http://www.macromates.com">TextMate</a> is meant to be the new cooler, hipper Mac Text Editor King. So I had a good look at that, but it seemed I was going to spend more time <a href="http://www.appletalker.com/forum/index.php?req=thread&amp;postid=4807">trying to get it doing what I wanted</a> (or what I thought it should do) rather than actually using it productively.

<a href="http://smultron.sourceforge.net/">Smultron</a> is really good and completely free, but I was having <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1589942&amp;forum_id=379995">similar issues</a> as I was with TextMate. It seems I want a combination of the two. The developer kindly <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1589946&amp;forum_id=379995">pointed me in the right direction</a> in the source code, but there is no chance of me getting my head around that.

At the moment, since to stand any chance of posting anything on this site I have to post via ssh from Work (ssh! don't tell them), I've resorted to using Vim. It maybe that Vim <a href="http://rails.vim.tpope.net/">does everything I want</a> anyway.
