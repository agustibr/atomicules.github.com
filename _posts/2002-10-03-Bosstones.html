<p>Went to see <a href="http://www.bosstones.com">Mighty Mighty Bosstones</a> last night at <a href="http://www.umu.man.ac.uk/">Manchester University</a> and had a suprise bonus of <a href="http://www.snuff.net">Snuff</a> supporting.  Good to see both of them since I haven&apos;t seen either for a couple of years.</p><p> Both are definitely getting old (as were NOFX at Reading).  Makes me wonder how old you can be and still be punk.  Be dead funny to see them at the age of 60 on stage.  Don&apos;t think they would be quite as lively somehow.</p><p>Walking through Manchester last night makes me want to be a student again.  Ohwell, live for the weekends now</p>
