<p>If you get an "Ole::Storage::FormatError: OLE2 signature is invalid" error when reading an Excel spreadsheet using <a href="http://roo.rubyforge.org/">Roo</a> it can probably be solved by resaving the spreadsheet (unfortunately using Excel) and making sure it is saving it as "Microsoft Office Excel Workbook (*.xls)", etc and not something odd.</p>
<p>I had two spreadsheets that had the .xls extension, but seems they were masquerading; when doing a Save As on them one was actually in a "Text (tab delimited)" format and the other in a "Web Page" HTML format. These were system generated files, so I guess that explains their odd form.</p>
<p>Couldn't find a whole lot of help out there about this.</p>
