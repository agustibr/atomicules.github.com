Tried to capture the early morning haze across the fields. Aware of how much this camera (and me) struggles to expose well for both light and dark areas I upped the lightness knob a bit, but then overexposed it (so missing most of the effect of the haze) and then also got a nice purple roller thing during development. But saying all that, I do still like it.
