<p>Well, back home a day early.  Gutted and glad all at the same time.  Have taken two right slams this holiday, one on the first day smashing my camera and the second with two days of the holiday to go.  Managed to knock myself out and didn&apos;t have a clue where I was staying when I woke up. </p><p>So came back early with Sean who had a dodgy Spannish belly, cost us 80 quid each to change our flights and then 25 quid each in a taxi from Liverpool.  But it was worth it, neither of  us could face another 24 hours of staring at Hotel walls</p><p>All in all we managed to bring back some fags that weren&apos;t for us, a dodgy stomach, knackered collarbone, smashed head and a smashed camera.  Quite a haul for a weeks trip</p>
