<p>So I really am keeping my word.  Seriously too busy to do anything to this site.  Which is a shame.  Still way off getting moveabletype up and running even though I installed it ages ago.  Had hoped for a quick implementation of a comment system using <a href="http://www.haloscan.com" >Haloscan</a> but it seems signups are closed.  Arse. </p>

<p>Have lots to add to the debt section.  Yes it seems to be getting worse.  Stupid Barclaycard put my limit up again.  Quite simply I need more of an income.  I&apos;m fed up of eating shite.  I already had a zero amount of money to live off the moment I got paid this month.  What&apos;s the point of working harder, longer, faster, when the money&apos;s the same at the end of the day?  Stupid bloody conscience and work ethic of mine</p>

<p>Anyway.  I&apos;m still way behind on my video work.  I&apos;m not sure where my evenings seem to go.  I&apos;ve taken months fannying about with DVDs, VCDs and SVCDs and I&apos;ve still to author the bit of video I spent ages editing.  I need <a href="http://www.roxio-shop.com/cgi-bin/shop/en/shop_main.cgi?func=rubrik&amp;wkid=4556563183&amp;rub1=Toast">toast</a>, which I&apos;ve ordered.  Unfortunately you can&apos;t download outside USA which means resorting to the old <a href="http://www.royalmail.com">real network</a> delivery 

which quite frankly is a pain in the arse when you&apos;re hardly at home.  Someone needs to come up with a better idea.  Anyway, when it eventually gets here I&apos;ll have a crack at SVCDs and hopefully that&apos;ll work on my bird&apos;s DVD player.</p>

<p>The good news is that the clock&apos;s have changed.  British Summer Time is here bringning light evenings.  So assuming I ever get out of work at a reasonable time then I might start skating a bit more since I&apos;ll be able to skate the park which is a bit more inspiring than Sainsbury&apos;s curb.</p>

<p>This weekend was Mia&apos;s 2nd birthday, and we all went to <a href="http://www.chesterzoo.org.uk/">Chester Zoo</a>.  I&apos;ve not been to the zoo in years and it was rad.  Should have some reasonable footage from the whole weekend, which means more fun editing for me.  Didn&apos;t think about that!  Ohwell, it can join the queue.</p>

<p>And I can&apos;t think of anything else to say</p>
