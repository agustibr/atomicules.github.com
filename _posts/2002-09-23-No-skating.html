<p>So I can't skate for a few weeks while I wait for my collarbone to heal.  (Went to the doctors on Friday and it is definitely not broken, I've just torn the ligament that connects my shoulder blade and collarbone.  That explains the bleeding and thus the nice yellowish bruise that covers my collarbone.)  An ideal oppurtunity to get more content on my website.  I didn't realise how much effort it takes to type stuff up, and it definitely isn't doing my arm any good!</p><p>Have started writing a story/review of the trip to Barcelona, so far I have manged to write 1300 words and haven't even got to boarding the plane.  Crikey! Expect it to be a few days until the story is complete.</p>
