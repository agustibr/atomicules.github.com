With all that time spent cycling fixed gear I just assumed I wouldn't have any need for that "pissy" little chainring when it came to riding a road bike. After all, why use that when I was used to standing up to get up hills, standing and leaning to get through headwinds and even, on occassion, snapping chains through sheer "GRRRrrr"-ness when facing the combination of both - or, indeed, getting off and walking.

But it turns out I love that little chain ring. I can sit down and spin up hills I had to walk up and I can battle the headwinds by simply spinning merrily away (getting nowhere fast, but hey, faster than before). Fantastic.
