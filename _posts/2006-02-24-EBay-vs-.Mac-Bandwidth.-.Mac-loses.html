title: EBay vs .Mac Bandwidth. .Mac loses.

<p>I've just checked my dotmac bandwidth usage to find that my site was probably down (I don't know; I didn't check) on the 13th, 14th and 15th of this month. I've amazingly shot up to over 10GB of files a month. I know I have a few large files on the fieldlife site, but I can't believe that many people have been downloading it. Therefore it must be the images I hosted for 29 ebay auctions I had running. Checking back I had a total of 29MB of images for my Auctions which means I could shift approx. 3GB with just 100 views of each auction. Ooops. Silly me. Think I'll have to see if I can optimise those images a bit better next time or just not run so many auctions at once. Anyway, if my site disappears you now know why. Check back on the 1st or 16th of the month as that's when my bandwidth gets reset.</p>
