Note to self: I realised I forgot to mention it here (although it is self-evident, I really should make a post for my own future reference) that after ten years of "i5m" I fancied a name change. A new beginning (of sorts) for the new year. And so I did. 

EDIT 2013-02-04: And as of today the i5m domains have gone as well. No point holding on to them any more.
