I use [ELinks](http://elinks.or.cz) a lot. I use [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) a lot. An awful lot.

I'm pretty happy with this, I see there are still some tweaks I can do to improve the various mobile pages, but bookmarking is now super fast. Because I've been using Luakit at work quite a bit, which means I'm without a Pinboard plugin or bookmarklet (until I write one), I have on occasion copied and pasted the link into ELinks in my ssh session and bookmarked to Pinboad there.
