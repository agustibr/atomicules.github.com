This is ace. I was wondering if anyone had done any mobile themes for Tumblr, and wondering if it was possible to serve up different themes (I doubt it?), but then problem solved.

You can use Tumblephone to instantly generate a mobile version of your site. iPhone optimised of course. Just add your Tumblr name at the end if the URL.

I'll have to get a link added to the footer of my site.
