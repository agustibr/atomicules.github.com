<p>I'm addicted to tabbed browsing, be it <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> or <a href="http://chimera.mozdev.org/">Chimera</a> (Probably even <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> if I had it) I just can't seem to help opening every link I click on in a new tab.  It's not like tabbed browsing is new and I don't even think I realise I am doing this.  There is obviously no need for this behaviour, but for some reason I seem to feel I must not move forward from the page I'm on (it's like I don't possess a <strong>back</strong> button), but instead must leave it intact incase there is a link I've left unexplored.  I really must stop or get a widescreen monitor to fit all those tabs</p>
