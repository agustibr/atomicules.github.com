Actually [taken the other morning on the way to work](https://twitter.com/#!/atomicules/status/184607501403172864); I spent my lunch time brushing the dirt off. It wasn't exactly what I was looking for as I was hoping for actual sunrise through the mist and I got neither since it was before dawn and the mist was barely visible. I think I have a very similar photo from this time last year taken on my APS film camera and should I eventually get my films developed it will be interesting to see how it compares. 

All that said, I love this shot and I think it may be the best picture I've ever got on Polaroid (well Fuji).
