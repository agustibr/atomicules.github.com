I've never been very supple. I can't ever remember being able to touch my toes as a kid, the nearest I could ever get was half way to two thirds down my shins, and this even though I was pretty sporty as a kid. I just kind of thought that was me.

One of the weirdest things that's happened as a result of my longer commute is increased suppleness. I can touch my toes, get my fingers on the floor. It's amazing. Like a new party trick for me. I don't know if it's because of the longer miles, more hill climbs (and therefore standing up) or faster bits on the route so I get a really high cadence (fixed gear bike),
but since I started it's really stretched out my legs.
