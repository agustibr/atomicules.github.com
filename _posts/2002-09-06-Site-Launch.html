<p>So the idea of my own site has been kicking around for about 2-3 years now.  Not very quick am I.  Think I&apos;ve finally got most of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a> to a point where I am happy with the look on windows and mac.  Happy enough for now anyway.  Please <a href="https://profiles.google.com/u/0/i5ivem/about">contact</a> me with any glarring errors.</p>
