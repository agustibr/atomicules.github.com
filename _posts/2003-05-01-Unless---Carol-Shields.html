<p>What else have I been doing?  I read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007137699/qid=1051829089/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/202-2199007-7966257">Unless by Carol Shields</a>.  I quite liked it.  I try to read entirely different novels from whatever I&apos;ve read previously to get a good range.  It gives me something to do on the train, although I do tend to read too quick. I should join a library I guess.</p>
