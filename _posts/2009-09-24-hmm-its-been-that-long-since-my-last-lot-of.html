<p>Hmm, it's been that long since my last lot of photos, that I forgot to blog about them when they finally came along. Anyway, we went to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/sets/72157622284301577/">a wedding</a>, which actually had good weather considering how crappy 'summer' has been as a whole.</p>
<p>This is one of my favs, and I've now fallen in love with Ektar. It really is fine grain, scans really well and just looks ace.</p>
