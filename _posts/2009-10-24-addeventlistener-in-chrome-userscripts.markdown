Also, not necessarily related to the previous post, but something else I had trouble with in Chrome userscripting was trapping clicks. I couldn't get [addEventListener to work on elements](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/11/01/avoid-common-greasemonkey-pitfalls.html?page=3). So instead I went for the document level, trapped all clicks, and filtered for what I was interested in.   

{% highlight javascript %}
document.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
	if (event.target.id == "whatyouarelookingfor")
	{
	//Do something 

	// Then just let the default carry on 
	}
},true);
{% endhighlight %}
