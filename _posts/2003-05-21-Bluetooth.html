<p>Honestly, this whole bluetooth thing rocks.  I get SMS messages appearing on my computer screen when my phone is sat over the otherside of the room.  I can then reply from my computer.  I didn&apos;t even hear that I&apos;d got a text because my phone was still on silent.  It&apos;s so cool.  God <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> rock.  And people use windows, why?</p>
