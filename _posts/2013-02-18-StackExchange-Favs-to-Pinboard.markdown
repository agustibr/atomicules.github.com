A little "weekend" script I wrote to import all my [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/) site favourites to [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/).

A lot of people would probably be unhappy if their Ruby programming skills had progressed as little as mine have (still using global variables, no classes, etc) in the six (?) years since I started using it, but I'm happier to focus on being crap in a whole mix of different languages rather than master just one and acknowledge that Ruby was just my gateway drug. Nothing beats Ruby for web automation though and it was a pleasant change being able to actually use APIs and not having to break out Mechanize and Nokogiri (which is what I have to do all the time at work).
