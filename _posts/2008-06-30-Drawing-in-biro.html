<p>When I was at school (and still had an ounce of creativity) I learnt about sketching in biro. Drawing in biro forces confidence in each line you make, since you can't go back and rub it out. You've got to get in right. You've got to be bold with the line you draw, do it in one confident stroke rather than timidly brushing the paper with a pencil. </p><p>The downside of drawing in Biro is that if you get the line wrong, you can't rub it out. It can get messy trying to correct it. All you can do is try to salvage what you've got, but the mistake will be there visible to all. Or if it comes to it, start again. Hopefully putting what you learnt about the previous sketch attempt to good use so you judge the line better this time.</p><p>I don't know what to do with this sketch. Overall it's not working out they way I wanted, not happy with it, but there are parts of it that I doubt I could re-create again - they are my best work.</p><p>I'm thinking I just need to keep the sketch and adjust my expectations. After all, it's been a long time since I've drawn anything at all.</p>
