<p>The spring <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/polaroidweek2009/">'Roidweek 2009</a>, was a lot of fun. First time doing it. My Polaroid camera is one of my favourite cameras even though it's rubbish. Peel apart film is one of the most fun experiences you can have. In life. Seriously. It's up there with cross processing and looking through the viewfinders of TLRs.</p>&#13;
