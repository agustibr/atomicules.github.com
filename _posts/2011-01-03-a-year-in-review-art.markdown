## Photography

It's been a bad year. Due to reasons (holiday, moving house, increased cost of keeping my bike running) that don't really make any sense I pretty much had to put a hold on my photography for a year. So I've a month to go until I get back into it by sending a backlog of film off. One (very) shallow "achievement" would be getting [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/4586247655/) to the front page of Explore during the spring 'roidweek, one of the few bits of photography I've done this year.  

## Music 

As to music, as previously mentioned Last.fm seems to have stopped scrobbling for me, but it's still the best indication I have:

### Top Ten Albums

1.   Ellie Goulding – Lights
2.   Two Door Cinema Club – Tourist History
3.   Audio Bullys – Higher Than The Eiffel   
4.   Florence + the Machine – Lungs
5.   She & Him – Volume Two
6.   Freestylers – Pressure Point
7.   Mumford & Sons – Sigh No More   
8.   Ou Est Le Swimming Pool – The Golden Year
9.   Freestylers – Adventures In Freestyle
10.  Shit Robot – From the Cradle to the Rave

I've not listened to Ellie and Mumford & Sons for the past few months, but must have clocked up some listens earlier last year (and data will be skewed towards the start of the year due to lack of recent scrobbles). I mostly listen to albums, so artists should be similar: 
 
### Top Ten Artists

1.   Freestylers
2.   Ellie Goulding
3.   Two Door Cinema Club
4.   Audio Bullys
5.   Catatonia
6.   Florence + the Machine
7.   She & Him
8.   Mumford & Sons
9.   Ou Est Le Swimming Pool
10.  La Roux

Hey, look at that, Freestylers at the top again. That is probably due to having four or five albums on my iPod all the time so in shuffle, especially of highly rated tracks, Freestylers get a lot of plays. I predict my ears need a change and I don't think they'll be at the top next year.  

## Literature

Reading. I need to read some more books. I read [one thing via the Kindle app]({{ site.baseurl }}2010/01/21/kindle-books.html) right at the start of the year. Depressing.
