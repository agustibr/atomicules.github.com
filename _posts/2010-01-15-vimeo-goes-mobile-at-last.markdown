Never been a big fan of YouTube and have always preferred Vimeo for hosting and watching video creations. That was until my main computing platform became an iPod and I was locked out of Vimeo. I'm glad they've finally sorted mobile (non-flash) access out. 

It may have taken them a long time, but they've done it in a beautiful way.

Maybe one day I'll get back into videography, but for now it remains photography.
