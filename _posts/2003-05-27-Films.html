<p>Well haven't managed to catch <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0234215">Matrix Reloaded</a> yet, the opening kind of clashed with Amy's birthday, and for some odd reason she didn't want to go and see it</p>

<p>My chances of actually getting to see it are slim, in a year of seeing each other the only time we've managed to get to the cinema together is to see "<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0251127">How to loose a guy in ten days</a>".  And I'm not to sure if I should be posting that on the internet.  I wanted to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0183649">Phone booth</a>, cus of Katie Holmes, but we just missed it, so we opted for the other.  Oh well, I'll be getting it on DVD anyway.</p>

<p>Not a lot of other news that I'm sure I should write about</p>
