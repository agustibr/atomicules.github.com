<p>Well haven&apos;t managed to catch <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0234215">Matrix Reloaded</a> yet, the opening kind of clashed with Amy&apos;s birthday, and for some odd reason she didn&apos;t want to go and see it</p>

<p>My chances of actually getting to see it are slim, in a year of seeing each other the only time we&apos;ve managed to get to the cinema together is to see "<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0251127">How to loose a guy in ten days</a>".  And I&apos;m not to sure if I should be posting that on the internet.  I wanted to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0183649">Phone booth</a>, cus of Katie Holmes, but we just missed it, so we opted for the other.  Oh well, I&apos;ll be getting it on DVD anyway.</p>

<p>Not a lot of other news that I&apos;m sure I should write about</p>
