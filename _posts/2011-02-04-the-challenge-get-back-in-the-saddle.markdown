Makes for scary reading. I don't know if I agree with the hi-vis and
helmet sentiments though. I certainly wear them, but as Alan writes it
isn't going to stop you getting hit.

[I had a scare last
week](http://twitter.com/#!/atomicules/status/29812717304946688) on a
roundabout. I have a hi-viz vest over my jacket and a hi-viz vest over
my rucksack (so I'm visible from all around). I have a bright front
light I use for seeing by and another little flasher for (hopefully)
being seen by. I have a rear light on my bike and a flashing light on
my rucksack. Also, since I've got winter tyres on at the moment they
have a reflective stripe all the way around them. Still this did not
stop a car colliding with me. It's a sad fact, but it doesn't matter
how visible you are, some drivers are just not looking for you
full-stop.

However, all that said, and I'm sure Alan would agree, for the most
part it's pretty safe on the roads. For every horror story like Alan's
there are thousands of journeys done each day without incident (and
probably without helmets and hi-viz too). The only way it's going to
get safer is if more people get on their bikes.
