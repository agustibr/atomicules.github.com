<p>My very belated shot for <a href="http://www.towelday.org/">Towel Day</a>. It was at least taken on the right day, I've just been delayed finishing the film off.</p>
<p>I went for a different approach to the "People with towel slung over shoulder" shot, an opted for my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberator_%28Blake%27s_7%29">Blake's 7 Liberator Starship</a> landing on a towely terrain; which I thought fitted the geeky/sci-fi theme well.</p>
<p>I can't decide if it is sad or cool that I still have a Blake's 7 Liberator Starship.</p>
<p>I'd hazard a guess at sad.</p>
