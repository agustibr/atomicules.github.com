Been reading this, that my own Mrs. Santa got me for Christmas.

- He had a longer period off cycling than me in 2011. Five whole weeks (if you believe he did as he was told) before his build up started for 2012.
- He has the opposite approach to me on "fuel". Eating just what he needs and adjusting this up/down to match his physical output. Whereas I barely eat enough whilst I'm cycling and try to eat more than I need when I'm not cycling (like an animal storing fat).

I am under no illusions that my levels of cycling are anywhere near his, but I found those bits interesting nonetheless.
