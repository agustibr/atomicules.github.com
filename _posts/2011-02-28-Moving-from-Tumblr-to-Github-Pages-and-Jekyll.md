This is just a placeholder post. I am in the (slow) process of moving from Tumblr to Github Pages and Jekyll. Why? Well, two reasons really: 1) I am a geek and just can not help tinkering with this kind of stuff. 2) Next year (2012) will mark the ten year anniversary of my web site and so I wanted to be able to have most of my archives back online, whereas the current Tumblr incarnation started afresh in 2009.

Since I have used a few different blogging tools (Nanoblogger, Rails, Tumblr) over the years it will take me some time to complete moving all my archives to the Jekyll format. No rush. I have a year.
