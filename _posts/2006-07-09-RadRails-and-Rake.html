<p>To fill in all the times at work when I should be doing engineering, but find it too boring I've been playing with RubyOnRails. Problems I've found on Windows:</p>



<ol>

<li>MySQL, would start via TCP/IP and I really think this is needed for rails. Found no one that has managed to get RoR running via named pipes. The solution here? Simple. restart. When restarted Mysql started all nicely. Bizarre. </li>



<li>Rake migrate can't be issued in RadRails. So <a href="http://www.rubyonrailsforum.com/rails-code-questions/122-before-updating-scaffolding-new-db-schema-try-creating-table-your-model-2.html">it won't create a table</a>, won't provide any feedback that is hasn't worked. Either do via command prompt or configure external application:

<ul>



<li>location: C:\ruby\bin\rake.cmd</li>

<li>working directory: ${project_loc}</li>

<li>arguements: ${string_prompt}</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>



<p>Works lovely</p>
