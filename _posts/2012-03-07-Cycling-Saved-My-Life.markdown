*Graeme Obree*

I wouldn't say I'm in anyway as near as dark place, but the year just gone and most certainly the start of this year has wrecked me mentally\*. And for sure, if it wasn't for cycling, I feel my mind would be in a much worse state.

\* Which is odd as I've been through much harder times before. I think it just goes to show that it isn't one big thing that breaks you, but the constant application of smaller niggles.
