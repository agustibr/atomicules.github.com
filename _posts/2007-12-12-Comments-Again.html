<p>Not a lot else to say, but I've decided to include Haloscan again for my comments. </p><p>Since each post isn't around for long/ever it also means for all intents and purposes comments related to each post will only be around until the next post.</p><p>I could have done my own with rubyonrails, but I couldn't see the point. I just don't have a lot of time. And now this is hosted locally (with naff uptime) I really don't think anyone reads it. So the effort in developing my own just isn't worth it.</p><p>So, in hindsight I should have re-enabled comments quite a while ago. But like the CSS, it all takes time!</p>
