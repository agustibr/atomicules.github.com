<blockquote><p>It will be winter soon on the East Coast.</p>
<p>Bundle up.</p></blockquote>

I could do with a fat bike come winter, at least until I reach the main roads. There's no one bike that's really suitable for my winter commute, but this would be great near home on the farm tracks. However, what I really like the look of are the gloves/muffs. I'm on three pairs of gloves already and it's not even cold - my hands are crap!

_As an aside, how did I miss this in LFGSS? I should have been in the actual [winter/snow bike thread](http://www.lfgss.com/newpostinthread55633.html)._
