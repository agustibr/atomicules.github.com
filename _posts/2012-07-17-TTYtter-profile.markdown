I had no intention of doing this today, it just happened. I couldn't figure out how to update my Twitter profile informaton from [TTYtter](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/) and it seemed to me like that is something you should be able to do from a twitter client, so I had a stab at writing an extension. It wasn't too tricky thanks to the [docs and examples](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/adv.html). On a related note, the [Perl documentation](http://perldoc.perl.org) is also really good; it's not as weird as it seems.
