I&apos;ve given in and decided to transfer all my photos to <a 

href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a>. As much as I&apos;d love to do my own 

thing or use something like <a 

href="http://www.fadingred.org/trac/snaps">Snaps</a>, it just seems <a 

href="http://www.rubyforums.com/showthread.php?p=3610">futile</a> when flickr 

works so easily and does the job so well.

</p>

<p>

A lot of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/">my photos</a> will be 

friends and family only. But, they'll be on flickr soon.

</p>

<p>

Next is what to do with this blog?
