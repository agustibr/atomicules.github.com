I recognize that it’s hypocritical for me to say this as the lead developer of Tumblr, which does not yet offer an automated feature for users to download backups of their blog content. So I took some time this week and started to write one. I’m happy to announce that Tumblr will be releasing an easy backup tool in the coming weeks. (I will also make an easy backup feature for Instapaper shortly.)

<p>Brilliant, looking forward to this. Lack of a backup has been my only worry about Tumblr (well that and the niggle about using any kind of free service: "If it seems too good to be true...")</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm also looking forward to native editing on the iPhone app. Why the hell does text get so screwed up when cutting and pasting???!!</p>
