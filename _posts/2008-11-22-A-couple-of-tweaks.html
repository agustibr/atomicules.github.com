<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure why I persist with this website, but I do. I&#39;ve just made a couple of little tweaks to the Twitter part (i.e. the tagline up above) and also to the flickr images pulled in.</p><p>The tagline uses the <a href="http://twitter.rubyforge.org/">Twitter gem</a> and used to simply pull in my latest status, but then I realised displaying @replies wasn&#39;t really great so I used my kludging coding abilities to loop through my timeline and find the first thing without an @</p><pre><code>twitter.timeline(:user).each do |t| tweet = t.text if t.text.match(&#39;^(?!@).*&#39;) break if t.text.match(&#39;^(?!@).*&#39;)end</pre></code><p>The flickr images use the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rflickr/">rflickr gem</a> (sadly development seems to have died). Which I&#39;ve already modified once to include the privacy_filter arguement of the <a href="http://flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html">flickr.photos.search</a> call, the fact that I managed to do this is a testament to the rflickr gem and the flickr API. I decided to modify it again to include the content_type filter so I could exclude screenshots, etc. After, naturally, initially assuming my coding abilities had mucked up, it seems there is a bug in the flickr API and it ignores the content_type setting. So for now this change is not working.</p><p>Oh, and I think I have just fixed my RSS feed as well so that it actually shows as updated in feed readers. I&#39;d missed out lastBuildDate.</p<p>It&#39;s all good news. Well apart from the flickr bug.</p>
