I've been uploading stacks (for me) of photos lately as I commence on my game of catchup and I guess lots of them will get missed; since I'm uploading as private and then working my way through them they won't necessarily show as "new". So that's a good excuse as any to pick a few out and put them here as well.

I really like this. Although I just can't work it out: I can't tell if it's an accidental double exposure (it would have to be as this camera can't do them) or whether this really is what was there. Whatever, I just can't help but keep looking at it.
