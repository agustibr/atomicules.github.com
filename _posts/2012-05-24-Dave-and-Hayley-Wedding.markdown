My photography has kind of been on halt for about two years. Wasn't planned or wanted, but [that's](https://twitter.com/atomicules/status/39805506075889664) [life](https://twitter.com/atomicules/status/39805594818985984). Anyway, fingers crossed it's now back on a gradual incline and I've **finally** been able to finish developing and uploading the photos from Dave and Hayley's wedding. There are a couple of corkers like the above so I guess it was worth the wait.
