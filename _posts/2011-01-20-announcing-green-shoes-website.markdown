<p>I really need to find time to give Green Shoes a whirl. <a title="Team Shoes: Satoshi Asakawa" href="http://twitter.com/ashbb">Ashbb</a> has done some great work. I'm hopeful that since it is pure Ruby it should be possible to install/build on OSX PPC as well - I never got Shoes 3 to build (some of the work between Shoes 2 and 3, yep, but the final Shoes 3 release, nope)</p>
