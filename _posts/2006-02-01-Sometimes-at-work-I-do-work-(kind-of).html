<p>I've been fiddling with VBA. it isn't nice, but is pretty easy to use. We use Autodesk: Inventor at work. It's a pretty cruddy 3D MCAD package, but WAY better than Autodesk: AutoCAD. In an effort to make life more interesting I thought I'd have a go at writing some macros in VBA. So far I've managed to produce two things:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/thread.jspa?threadID=449931">Calculating the mass of visible items only</a></li>

<li><a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/thread.jspa?threadID=452211">Plotting views 1:1</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Both of these macros overcome some of the major short comings from Inventor, that any application at rev 10 shouldn't have.</p>

<p>As you can see the response from the Inventor Community is as great as the response I received at work ("Get on with what you are meant to be doing!")</p>
