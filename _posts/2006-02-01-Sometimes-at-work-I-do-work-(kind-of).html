<p>I&apos;ve been fiddling with VBA. it isn&apos;t nice, but is pretty easy to use. We use Autodesk: Inventor at work. It&apos;s a pretty cruddy 3D MCAD package, but WAY better than Autodesk: AutoCAD. In an effort to make life more interesting I thought I&apos;d have a go at writing some macros in VBA. So far I&apos;ve managed to produce two things:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/thread.jspa?threadID=449931">Calculating the mass of visible items only</a></li>

<li><a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/thread.jspa?threadID=452211">Plotting views 1:1</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Both of these macros overcome some of the major short comings from Inventor, that any application at rev 10 shouldn&apos;t have.</p>

<p>As you can see the response from the Inventor Community is as great as the response I received at work (&quot;Get on with what you are meant to be doing!&quot;)</p>
