<p>Don't applaud, it's not like it required any effort on my part, just flicking a switch in Nanoblogger. I wasn't going to bother with them because I thought "Who the hell reads this crap anyway?" and "Of those people who will be using RSS and want to know when <strong>a</strong> certain area of the site gets updated?"</p>

<p>However, someone found a broken link on my site and it occurred to me I hadn't checked through my links in a while. Lo and behold when I did I had hundreds of errors because I'd forgotten to edit out the category feed links from my templates. So I thought, rather than update my templates and then almost every page on this site I'd just turn on creation of the category feeds (and update almost every page on this site), after all what harm can it do?</p>

<p>So, there you have it. If you want to ignore 99% of the drivel on this site you can now subscribe to just the sensible portions of the site (I'll leave you to decide what they are) and check back once a year</p>
