<p>Don&apos;t applaud, it&apos;s not like it required any effort on my part, just flicking a switch in Nanoblogger. I wasn&apos;t going to bother with them because I thought &quot;Who the hell reads this crap anyway?&quot; and &quot;Of those people who will be using RSS and want to know when <strong>a</strong> certain area of the site gets updated?&quot;</p>

<p>However, someone found a broken link on my site and it occurred to me I hadn&apos;t checked through my links in a while. Lo and behold when I did I had hundreds of errors because I&apos;d forgotten to edit out the category feed links from my templates. So I thought, rather than update my templates and then almost every page on this site I&apos;d just turn on creation of the category feeds (and update almost every page on this site), after all what harm can it do?</p>

<p>So, there you have it. If you want to ignore 99% of the drivel on this site you can now subscribe to just the sensible portions of the site (I&apos;ll leave you to decide what they are) and check back once a year</p>
