<p>It seems like Haloscan have died a death. I mean the website is still there and it still works, but the forum is dead. There is no one from Haloscan around.</p><p>With that in mind I've finally got around to doing comments properly via rails. Since this site is on rails. It wasn't too hard (it shouldn't be I guess, but I'm very rusty), but it is only very basic, no user logon (probably a good thing!), no editing. Just comment and run.</p><p>Will probably need a bit of tweaking, but it seems to be basically working. I could do with making the comment appear via AJAX, etc rather than re-loading the whole page. But it'll do - I have to remember NO ONE reads this site anyway (especially since I've become very energy aware and I'm sleeping my machine/webserver much more than I used to!)</p><p>Nothing really negative to say, this is just an in-between post. It'll soon be gone. Oh, and as each post goes so do the comments. More Yay!</p>
