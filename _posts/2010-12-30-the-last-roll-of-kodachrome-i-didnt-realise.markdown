<a href="http://www.dwaynesphoto.com/">The Last Roll of Kodachrome</a>. 

I didn't realise you could get a t-shirt! 

I did [my one and only roll of Kodachrome](http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/sets/72157623338750353/) back in 2009, giving myself plenty of time before this years deadline. Perhaps I could have left things a bit later, but then again some guy did get in a [last minute order of 1,580 rolls](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/us/30film.html?_r=3&hp) of Kodachrome, so maybe I was wise to do mine earlier afterall.
