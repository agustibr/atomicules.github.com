What the hell is this all about? When I first heard this term in connection with the gym I never twigged it had anything to do with cycling. I didn't know what it was, but assumed it was something more exciting that sitting on an exercise bike, which is up there with running on a treadmill as one of the the most pointless boring things to do ever. I just do not understand the point in it. Why not, you know, actually go out for a run or a bike ride? Lost on me...
