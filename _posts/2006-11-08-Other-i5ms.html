Prompted by a comment from another i5m I thought I&apos;d post about the other i5ms I&apos;ve found. So far

there are two:

</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.myspace.com/i5m">i5m on Myspace</a> who is also on 

<a href="http://webjay.org/by/i5m">webjay</a></li>

<li><a href="http://i5m.spaces.live.com/">the i5m that posted a comment</a></li>

</ul>

<p>

Someone recently registered my old .co.uk domain and it appears to be a <a href="http://webwhois.nic.uk/cgi-bin/whois.cgi?query=i5m.co.uk&amp;WHOIS+Submit.x=0&amp;WHOIS+Submit.y=0">real 

person</a>, so perhaps there might be three soon.

</p>

<p>

I find it odd that other people have the i5m name since mine was accidental

more than anything. I&apos;d been using the nickname <strong>ism</strong>, on a 

mac forum, which

I nicked from an old <a href="http://www.wobblyweb.com/ue/37139.html">Liverpool 

dance/techno group</a> that I once saw in passing

at some free festival in London that I travelled to on some hippy bus. 

Incidentally, in searching for that ISM link again I found that one of the 

members is <a href="http://www.myspace.com/babyvibes">on myspace</a>. I also

liked ism because of all the words that end in ism. Such as cynicism. Of course

when it came to domain names ism was well gone so I went for i5m. I wonder how 

the other two ended up there?
