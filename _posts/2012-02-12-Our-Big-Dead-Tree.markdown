Had so many planned shots for this tree, especially if I could get it laden with crows or the crows just taking off. And then it got cut down. It's easy to think there is no point in taking photos of the things that are around us, after all - they will be there tomorrow. But sometimes they are not. For me, it seems the pace of significant change in my environment is about on par with the rate at which films are being discontinued. Need to hurry up.
