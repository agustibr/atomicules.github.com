title: A Year in Review... Cycling
categories:

This is the year when cycling changed from being just how I get to work to being more of a lifestyle; basically because I'm spending anywhere between two and a half to four hours (those goddamn headwinds!) in the saddle each week day. So it is still how I get to work - I rarely cycle in addition to my commute - but 190 miles a week means I clocked up over  7500km last year. And seeing as how we only moved house seven months into the year (changing from a short commute to the long one), this year my total mileage will be even more. Crazy.
