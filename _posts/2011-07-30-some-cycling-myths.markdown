To go hand in hand with my last post celebrating my crazy cycling anniversary I thought I'd put together some of my opinions on cycling myths. There are some things you don't _need_, even if they would be great to have

* Lycra (or cycling specific clothing) - The whole [past year](http://atomicules.co.uk/2011/07/25/1-year-1-gear-and-8448-miles.html) has been done without any lycra whatsoever. I'm quite sure my rear end would welcome some padding, but I've got by ok with tracksuit bottoms in the winter and some 3/4 length cut offs (I got for holiday 6 years ago) in the summer. Same goes for jersey's. Whilst I'm quite sure a £75 jersey would be nice, A normal t-shirt will do the job just fine. You are going to sweat and get soggy - there's no avoiding that whatever  you wear. The only thing you really do need are gloves (and those over a helmet - I do wear a helmet though). 
* Foot Retention - You don't need clipless pedals and shoes. The ye-olde traditional toe-strap is fine. And you don't desperately need foot retention of any kind even when cycling fixed gear - whatever people might say (I don't use any [in winter](http://atomicules.co.uk/2010/12/27/winter-cycling.html)) - as long as you have brakes that is. But toe-clips are a very cheap nice-to-have off eBay, since everyone goes clipless.
* An expensive bike - Mine was £199 from Halfords. Ok, it's had a new rear wheel, a new set of bearings in that wheel, two bottom brackets and countless spokes.  But most of those bits need replacing anyway on whatever bike you get.I'm sure a £1000 bike would be nice, but you certainly don't need it.
* Gears - Well, that almost goes without saying. Unless where you live is very hilly, turns out you actually don't need gears. Although I really hope at minimum I can afford to do a summer/winter ratio. 42:16 is fine for summer, but I need a little less for those winter tyres. 
* [Wider rims for wider tyres](http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html#ETRTO) - Perhaps a more risky experiment, but I ran [35c tyres on 13c rims](http://atomicules.co.uk/2010/12/27/winter-cycling.html) for months with just one issue.
