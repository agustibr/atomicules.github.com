<p>Oh great.  On the way home from skating town I nearly get mugged in Fartown.  That's about 6 years in total of living in Fartown, 4 years in the present location, and no trouble like that.  I've always defended the place as not that bad.  I'm glad I'm going to the quietest place in the world.  I don't need that kind of crap.  I'm just glad I had my skateboard with me, I think it put him off enough to stop him really trying something, although fuck knows what I would have done with it.  At least I can still run.</p>
