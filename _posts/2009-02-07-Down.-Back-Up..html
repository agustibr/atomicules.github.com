<p>Back up after being down.</p><p>Ooops, for some unknown reason my mysql instance had stopped running, killing my website. No idea when that happened - I don&#39;t check often.</p><p>If I was clever I&#39;d at least have some kind of notification if someone tried to reach my site. But I don&#39;t know how to do that.</p><p>But then I start thinking, what is the point of this site? I don&#39;t have many big things to say anymore. It&#39;s all Twitter now.</p><p>I should at least fix my error page.</p><p>I wonder if I could transfer to using SQLite?</p>
