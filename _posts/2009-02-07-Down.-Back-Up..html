<p>Back up after being down.</p><p>Ooops, for some unknown reason my mysql instance had stopped running, killing my website. No idea when that happened - I don't check often.</p><p>If I was clever I'd at least have some kind of notification if someone tried to reach my site. But I don't know how to do that.</p><p>But then I start thinking, what is the point of this site? I don't have many big things to say anymore. It's all Twitter now.</p><p>I should at least fix my error page.</p><p>I wonder if I could transfer to using SQLite?</p>
