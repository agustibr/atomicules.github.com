[I Break Horses - Winter Beats](http://soundcloud.com/bella-union/i-break-horses-winter-beats).

Been loving this album this week. I hoped I would when I read [this review](http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2011/08/i-break-horses-hearts-2/). It's more chilled out than anything else I've liked recently and kind of dreamy. Can't help myself from hitting the repeat button.
