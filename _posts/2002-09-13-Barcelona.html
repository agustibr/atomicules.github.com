title: Notes from EasyInternet Cafe in Barca
categories: pushing
---
<p>Well I am in Barcelona, not that anyone reads this and has been wondering where I am anyway, but still.  I resisted the lure of the internet quite well until everyone I was out with decided the peep show was a good idea.  Been there, done that.  So I decided to come to the EasyInternet cafe next door.  As if these places exist.  </p> <p>Spanish keyboards do my head in. Well complicated.  I keep getting none UTF-8 characters as well, not good for validation.</p><p> Anyway, wasn't gonna post while I was away since it is an open invitation to break into my house and rob me blind. </p><p> Barca is rad and I want to move here, definitely.  I'm stoked. </p><p> Came on a skateboarding mission, mainly to film since I can't seem to skate for toffee nowadays, but unfortunately, being me, I smashed my brand new camera on the first day of filming.  So since then I have been mainly getting pissed on what little money I've got.</p>
