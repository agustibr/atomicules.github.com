<p>Well winter is here.  Arse.  I can remember the last one far too well, it seemed to last forever, and all there is to do is get wankered every night.  Well, perhaps not this year I can't afford another Â£2000 just on beer and I also probably need to keep my current job.</p> <p>So as usual JUST as I am leaving the house to go skating it starts raining.  How does the rain know when I'm leaving? Amazing trick it's got there.  So that's me not skating for probably another week unless I actually get my lazy arse out of the house next week. </p>
