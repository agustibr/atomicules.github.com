<p>I've updated my i5m domain so it points to my newhost, but I had a couple of days where my site was just pointing to their server page instead of my site directory there. All is well and good now. However, the first step has been to redirect it straight back over to dotmac for the time being while I can rebuild my site for the new host and sort a load of other stuff out.</p>
