<p>Since I'm skint I'm afraid I can only afford to round two corners per box. Well, that and I can use the excuse that "Actually, I wanted it to be that way"</p>

<p>I've been playing about. The best article I've found so far is this one: <a href="http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/wrongWithIE/eightpointbox.html">Fluid frame using before: and after:</a> since I would like round corners, but I don't want to <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/customcorners/">compromise my mark-up with loads of extra divs</a> and I'm not clever enough to use <a href="http://pro.html.it/esempio/nifty/">javascript to create rounded corners</a>. In theory I could round all corners using generated content (as per that first link), but it has issues with Gecko and since I at least want this to work in Gecko based browsers (I use <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org">Camino</a>) and KHTML ones I've opted for just the two corners. It should still be reasonable looking in IE as well (I think one corner will be rounded!)</p>

<p>I'm quite happy with it. It looks alright. It's still a nice fluid layout.  I've had to lose the borders on boxes (no biggy) as I haven't figured out how to stop the square border on the round corner and it looks silly like that.</p>

<p>Next I need some drop shadows or perhaps rounded borders. I think this will be really tricky without extra markup though</p>
