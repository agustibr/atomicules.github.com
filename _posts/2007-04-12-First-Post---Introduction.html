<p>A brand new site. I couldn't help myself. This one is a lot more simple though. There's no history for starters, it's just going to be one post at a time and when it's gone it's gone. So I'll leave this post here for a bit and then get on with the real posting. Not that I have so much to say nowadays - I think I just needed to be tinkering with something rather than actually ranting about stuff which is why I've developed this site without ever really meaning to.</p><p>I got rid of my webhost and domain names to save a bit of cash (the price of beans on toast has gone up) so this is hosted on my mac at home. I can guarantee a 4.3% uptime. Well actually, it'll be quite good as long as it stays plugged in since the battery is screwed on my ageing 12" powerbook.</p><p>I've used <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a> (not exactly pushing the boundaries of it, but it was fun for me) to develop this site and <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">Mongrel </a>to serve it.</p><p>Since I've been accused of being too negative in the past with each post (this one excepted since it's an introduction) I've forced myself to  present a positive and negative side to it. I predict this column (the one you are reading right now) will always be the longest, but the other one will always get something in it. I thought I'd write more in it now just so it feels good about itself.</p>
