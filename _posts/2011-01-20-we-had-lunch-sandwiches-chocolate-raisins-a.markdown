_Ansel Adams, Rock and Surf._ 

My very darling wife* got me Ansel Adam's Examples - The making of 40 Photographs for Christmas. She also got me The Camera, but so far Examples is the one I've really taken a shine to. 

Stories are probably what I like most about photography. I couldn't really care less about the technical details, but I just love to hear the story behind a photo and although I might have picked a rather inane quote on purpose just to make a point, when flicking through the book this is the one that I remembered the most. It just makes it all the more real and enjoyable for me.

One of the most memorable and favourite photos on Flickr for me is [this by Anita Jean](http://www.flickr.com/photos/neetss/4668407077/in/faves-i-5-m/) just because I love the story and it has just stuck in my head ever since.

I am also pleased to find out from reading Examples that I'm standing in good stead by also not having a clue when half my photos were taken. Who needs notes.
