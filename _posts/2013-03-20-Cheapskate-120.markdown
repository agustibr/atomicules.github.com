My incredibly cunning plan for affordably shooting more film this year than last year is to switch to exclusively shooting medium format in black and white only. This is because I can then send off rolls for development only, which is the cheapest possible option (I would still *love* to home develop, but initial outlay costs are too high for me), and then use my [cheapskate scanning](http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/4355900524/in/set-72157623306521091) approach on the negatives. By shooting 120 format I can get a decent resolution scan even with my scanner. Also, I really have not used my Yashica Mat as much as it deserves to be used so it's a sensible idea all round.

I just wish I had of thought of this before I bought a new roll of 35mm film.
