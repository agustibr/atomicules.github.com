<p>Webkit browsers are really kicking Gecko based one's at the moment. Both in the rendering engine speed and in javascript speed. So this is good to see. I managed to get this working in <a href="http://www.slax.org">Slax</a> using the <a href="http://www.slax.org/modules.php?action=detail&amp;id=409">deb2lzm module</a> and installing these other two modules: <a href="http://www.slax.org/modules.php?action=detail&amp;id=517">libgconf2-4</a> and <a href="http://www.slax.org/modules.php?action=detail&amp;id=520">Liborbit2</a>. It crashes like mad, which could either me something else I've missed in Slax or just that this is a very early developer release.</p>&#13;
<p>As far as OSX goes, there's a lot of people moaning about lack of PPC support, but PPC is dead so there really is no point developing for it. It's a shame, but there are <a href="http://stainlessapp.com/">alternatives</a>.</p>
