One of mine and the missus' best drunken rambling ideas ever was that, rather than watch some averagely funny film we've seen umpteen times before, we should spend Saturday nights listening to some music - each of us picking something new for us to listen to. Unfortunately like many a good drunken idea it has never actually happened and now we just end up watching x-factor with the girls. Such is life. 


* _Shit Robot - From the Cradle to the Rave_. Like judging a porridge by it's packaging I just knew by the name this would be anything but Shit. Love it. Lots. 
* _Blood Red Shoes - Fire Like This_. Gets off to a right good start with Don't Ask, but then... well it just seems to pass by and end. I've tried listening to it a couple of times and it's the same: great start then before I realise it, it's finished  and I've not noticed it. Not sure what's up with that. This is probably why I'm never that enthusiastic to check out music recommended by Last.fm - it's just not quite there (I don't think).  
* _Bombay Bicycle Club - I Had the Blues but Shook Them Free_. Had this for a while and never got around to listening. Wasn't in the mood for it. Still not really. Always Like This is awesome, but the only stand out for me.
* _Ou Est Le Swimming Pool - The Golden Year_. How incredibly sad really the whole story with their lead singer. Wonder if they will carry on? Great album though. Had the Kings of Perignon track for quite awhile - think it was in Annie Mac's Top Ten Track's at one point which is how I found it.  
* _Beatbullyz - Human Nature_. Where did I hear of these? Must have been on Huw Stephen's podcast. I went and found Keyz to Life, Wham and 6 Music to a Stereo. Great tracks. The album is ok, but not as good as those tracks. Bit too well produced for it's own good. 
* _Two Door Cinema Club - Tourist History_. This is where I am absolutely, totally and irrevocably wrong about Last.fm recommendations. Oh why did I ignore these for so long? Thanks to the excellent video for Come Back Home for prompting me to go and listen. Superb album.
* _The Drums - The Drums_. I had Let's Go Surfing free from iTunes for awhile and listened and never thought much of it. Then I saw the video (NME channel, same time as Two Door Cinema Club), which isn't actually that much, but for whatever reason made me hear the song again and I like it. However, it is probably the best on the album (I say probably though, and same feelings go for Blood Red Shoes, because perhaps I just haven't listened to them properly yet - after all I didn't think much of Let's Go Surfing the first time round).
* _Smoke Fairies - Frozen Heart_. Which just goes to show that just because they are pretty girls and TLOBF mentioned them, that I shouldn't necessarily listen to them. Not my cup of tea. 
* _Mad Caddies - Keep it going_. Sadly, it seems they haven't. Oh well, there's always Duck and Cover and Just One More which I shall never tire from listening to.
* _Crystal Castles - Crystal Castles II_. Argh! Noise! Not for me. I think I remembered these (from the NME channel one night) quite a bit better than they actually are.
