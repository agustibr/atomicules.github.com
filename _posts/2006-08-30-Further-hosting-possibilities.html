<p><a href="http://hosting.media72.co.uk/">Media72</a> are a very impressive, new (to hosting) UK based (although not servers at the mo&apos;) company. I&apos;d go with them for the RoR support, but they don&apos;t have Webdav access. Yet. However, <a href="http://www.ocssolutions.com/virtual-hosting.php">OCS Solutions</a> seem top notch in everything they offer, so I think I&apos;m off there for the time being. Just a few queries to go before I make the leap, although I&apos;m not doing any yearly plan things again.</p>
