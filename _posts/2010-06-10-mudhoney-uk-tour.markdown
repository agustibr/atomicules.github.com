Wow. I didn't even realise they were still going. Brings back memories - not that I've seen them; never did get to see them live when I was really into them (school years), but I associate them with good times. Plus Pokin' Around is on my (now defunct) Muxtape (basically my all time favourites mixtape).

Unfortunately I think my gig days are over, which is a shame as this is actually in reach.
