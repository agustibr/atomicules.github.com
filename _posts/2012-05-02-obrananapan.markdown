Apparently, Graeme Obree said that [bananas and marzipan](http://philsroadbikingblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/meeting-graeme-obree-part-ii.html) are good foods for cycling. So I thought why not combine the two? And that's precisely what I did: Banana wrapped in marzipan. Awesome.

(It kind of feels as if this post should have a picture, but it would just be a yellow blob and you can easily imagine that yourself).

_(Also, apologies for all the cycling related posts lately. I have some code related ones on the back burner, but they take significantly more time to get to fruition)_
