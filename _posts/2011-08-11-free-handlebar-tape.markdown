The [el-cheapo bar tape](http://www.sjscycles.co.uk/velox-cotton-cloth-adhesive-handlebar-tape-black-prod12629/) I put on last year was so worn that my handlebars consisted of more electrical tape (patching up the "holes") than original bar tape. However, even though bar tape is considered one of the cheapest upgrades there was no money in the bank for any more so I had a brainwave and used an old inner tube.

I cut either side of the valve, then cut around the circumference so I had one long strip, then cut that in half lengthways so I had two pieces of "tape". Even though it's not sticky, because it's rubber and stretches you can pull it tight wrapping it round so it will stay in place. Just needs a bit of electrical tape to secure at either end. Was plenty long enough (had to cut a bit off).

Seems good so far:

* Waterproof
* Hard wearing
* Doesn't budge
* Naturally vibration absorbing
* Non-slip grip

Cheapskate cycling for the win!
