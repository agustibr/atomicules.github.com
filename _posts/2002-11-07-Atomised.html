<p>The most semi-interesting thing is that the other week, due to the shitty train strikes that have been happening recently up north, I decided to buy a book from WHSmiths at Manchester Picadilly.  This was in preparation for the bloody coach journey I would have to take since the trains weren&apos;t running.  I haven&apos;t read a book in a while let alone bought one, but ended up buying <a href="http://www.richmondreview.co.uk/books/atomised.html">Atomised</a>, by Michel Houllebecq.  It is <a href="http://www.impacdublinaward.ie/2002/Winner.htm">Winner of the International IMPAC Dublin Literaty Award 2002</a>.   So I was expecting something quite good, it sounded pretty interesting. </p><p>It definitely is different.  Some parts I found a bit tricky to follow since it seemed to keep jumping back and forth along the timeline.  However, about two thirds of the way through I was thinking "there must be more depth to this book than what has happened so far?".  Or unless I was particulary shallow, but that&apos;s not me that&apos;s <a href="http://www.hotornot.com/r/?emid=EREUKZ">Dave</a>.  Anyway, as it turns out it pulls a right ending out of the bag.  So pretty good. I could see this ending up as some wierd film.  Read some more reviews <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099283360/qid=1036627166/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_3_2/026-7242428-7987649"> here</a>.  Worth a read as long as you don&apos;t mind gratuitous wanking</p>
