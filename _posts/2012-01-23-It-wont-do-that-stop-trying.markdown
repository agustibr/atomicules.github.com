Yay! Let's post some pictures for the first time in a billion years. I've kind of avoided posting around New Year time because of the temptation of doing an "End of Year Review" thing and I'm not (really) going there this year (although I'll kind of mention that again in another post soon). However, I did want to post a picture of my wonderful Christmas presents (thanks to my very own Christmas Elf) which were some instant film and [Learn You a Haskell for a Great Good](http://www.learnyouahaskell.com), which has been on my wishlist since [then]({{ site.baseurl }}2011/04/12/Talking-of-Haskell.html). So I thought I'd try (again) to see if I could get some kind of close-up lens working with my crappy [Reporter](http://polaroids.theskeltons.org/drptr.htm) - and as you can see, I couldn't.
