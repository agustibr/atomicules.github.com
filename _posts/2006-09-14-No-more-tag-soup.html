<p>This site should now be served properly as application/xhtml+xml and not

 as text/html. Since I&apos;m now on a proper webhost I have no excuse to do

 otherwise anymore. I&apos;ve given up trying to get it to work in Internet

Explorer as well. I&apos;ve tried all kinds of mod_rewrite stuff and none

works. Still, there is no excuse to be using it anymore.</p>

<p>I should be moving over to Lighttpd soon so perhaps I&apos;ll try again

there.Oh well, keeps me entertained.</p>
