<p>Anyone who knows me knows I like the <a href="http://www.thefreestylers.com" >Freestylers</a>, and I really, really like the new album Raw As Fuck. Unfortunately not on the iTunes Music Store, but why not get it here if in the UK: <a href="http://www.karmadownload.com/artist/?Freestylers">Karmadownloads</a>? Wow. &pound;7 for bliss. Ok so there&apos;s one less track than on the album, but you can&apos;t complain.</p>

<p>Music download charts. The BBC have just launched their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/top40/download.shtml" >music download chart</a>. What can I say? Technological progress obviously doesn&apos;t mean improvements in taste of the nation.</p>
