I think I remember seeing this a while back ([Ah, yes, I do](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/10/15/sublime-text)) when it was Windows only, but Sublime 2 it will be cross platform. Which makes this the first decent alternative to Vim I've seen. I downloaded it to give it a quick spin and it is interesting, especially the multi-select bit; you can use CTRL to select multiple bits of non-continous text and then start typing and all selections are replaced simultaneously. Also, it comes with the [Solarized](http://i5m.co.uk/code/art/2011/04/02/Solarized.html) colour schemes built in. However, I don't think I'll be switching from Vim though, too much time invested there already.
