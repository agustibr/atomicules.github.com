<p>So I've had quite possibly the shitest Friday in a while: My girlfriends pissed with me (suprise!), made fuck up at work, had to walk home from work, got blisters on my feet, stink and am sweaty.  So I thought I'd listen to James to deepen my black mood.  Really fancied 'sometimes' on the way home.  But now after listening to all of laid I'm on Seven and it's just ace.  I'm actually starting to feel in a better mood, which is shit in a way cus I was going to have a right bitch.  Oh well.  Wish I had a beer.  Wish I didn't have to go to work tomorrow.  And walk there and back at that.  Someone make me un-poor.  Please. </p>
