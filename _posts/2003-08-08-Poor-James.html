<p>So I&apos;ve had quite possibly the shitest Friday in a while: My girlfriends pissed with me (suprise!), made fuck up at work, had to walk home from work, got blisters on my feet, stink and am sweaty.  So I thought I&apos;d listen to James to deepen my black mood.  Really fancied &apos;sometimes&apos; on the way home.  But now after listening to all of laid I&apos;m on Seven and it&apos;s just ace.  I&apos;m actually starting to feel in a better mood, which is shit in a way cus I was going to have a right bitch.  Oh well.  Wish I had a beer.  Wish I didn&apos;t have to go to work tomorrow.  And walk there and back at that.  Someone make me un-poor.  Please. </p>
