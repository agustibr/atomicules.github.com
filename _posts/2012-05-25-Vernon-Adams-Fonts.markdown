I meant to link to this _ages_ ago - I thought I had, but it seems I forgot. I love this guy's fonts so much I'm now using three of them: [Damion](http://www.google.com/webfonts/v2/specimen/Damion), [Trocchi](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Trocchi) and [Muli](http://www.google.com/webfonts/v2/specimen/Muli). I'm tempted to use more although I'm probably already overdoing it. He seems to be very talented and crazily kind to let people use all these for free.
