<p>Unbeknown to each other Piero and I were both working on a followup to this plugin. The main focus being able to display the start and end time codes of a clip as either the In/Out points or the clip Media limits.</p>

<p>Piero, beat me there, added timecode handle displays (media before/afer in/out points) as well AND made the performance of the plugin a lot better to boot!</p>
