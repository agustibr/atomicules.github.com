title: Almost a real website again

<p>I now have real domains again instead of the <strong>i5m.is-a-geek.org</strong> <a href="http://www.dyndns.com/">dyndns</a> one. A new one: <strong>i-5-m.net</strong> and the old one resurrected: <strong>i5m.me.uk</strong>. They get here through the wonders of <a href="http://www.everydns.net/">EveryDNS</a>.</p><p>I thought I&#39;d lost the i5m.me.uk one. It wasn&#39;t until looking for new domain names I found out it was still registered to me. What happened was, that last year after just renewing it, I had a paddy because I couldn&#39;t afford to keep my hosting (even though it was only about a fiver a month - hey they were poor times) so I left my registrar and binned my registration certificate, thinking I&#39;d just let it expire. Fortunately I managed to reestablish my identify with <a href="http://www.nominet.org.uk/registrants/onlineservices/faq/#detaggeddomain">Nominet</a> and get it back.<p>I don&#39;t know why, but it just feels better having a proper domain name again.</p><p>Normal, sporadic, posting will resume.</p><p>I&#39;m still keeping my hosting on my mac (I get relatively good uptime thanks to my missus always being on Facebook). Can&#39;t justify a real host at the moment, even though I could probably afford it now. Just no real need for it at the mo&#39;.</p>
