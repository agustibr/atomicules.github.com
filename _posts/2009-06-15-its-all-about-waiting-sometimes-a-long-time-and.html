<p>It's all about waiting. Sometimes a long time. And then after all that waiting you realise you are going to have to wait longer still.</p>
<p>My dad gave my my Great Grandpa's <a href="http://www.camerapedia.org/wiki/Kodak_No._2A_Folding_Autographic_Brownie">Kodak No. 2-A Folding Autographic Brownie</a> in November last year. Since it is an old <a href="http://www.camerapedia.org/wiki/116_film">116 format</a> camera, It took me months toÂ  convert it to 120 format, and then because I'd put a slow (160 iso) film in it, it took me ages to shoot the roll of film over the dull winter months, even though there are only 8 frames per roll!</p>
<p>So we have a camera that has taken 80 to 90 years to come into my hands...</p>
<p>...a seven month wait until I have the first film back...</p>
<p>...and then that has light leaked...</p>
<p>...So I shall repair the bellows (they didn't seem to be in such bad nick!)...</p>
<p>...and wait until I can buy a new roll of film...</p>
<p>...and wait until I can send it off for processing...</p>
<p>...and then, hopefully, the wait will be over.</p>
<p>More from the first roll, and also how I went about converting the camera to 120 format, can be found in my set on Flickr: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/sets/72157613490634837/">Kodak No. 2-A Folding Autographic Brownie</a>. I also have some links saved on Delicious: <a href="http://delicious.com/i5m/116">116</a> film format stuff. <strong>EDIT:</strong> Now on Pinboard.in instead: <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:i5m/t:116/">116 film format links</a>.</p>
