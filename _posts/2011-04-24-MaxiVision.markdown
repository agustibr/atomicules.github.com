Meant to mention this about three months ago, when it was actually posted, but somehow never got around to it. Anyway, I'm not so interested in the article because of cinema (although agree with the anti-3D sentiments - I've never seen a 3D movie and don't want to - and I am interested in the technical details behind [Maxivision](http://web.archive.org/web/20021006053821/http://www.geocities.com/hollywood/makeup/4303/maxivision.html)), rather that it gives me hope: Although my photography is on hold indefinitely I do want to get back to it one day. And if film stock remains for cinema use (even just distribution), this means it should be around a while longer for photography as well.
