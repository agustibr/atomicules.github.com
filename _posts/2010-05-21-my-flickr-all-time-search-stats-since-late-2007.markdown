My Flickr all time search stats, since late 2007, click on the image to get more info.

Awhile ago Flickr [changed from providing all-time stats](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2009/03/16/stats-for-today-and-more-yesterdays/) to a rolling 28 days. They then [made available for download](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2010/03/03/historical-referrer-data/), for a limited time, the historical all-time data. This 'limited time' comes to the an end at 01-Jun-2010, and to be honest I wasn't going to bother downloading almost sixty Excel/CSV files dating back to 2007, because the likelihood was I'd never do anything with them. But then I heard about [flickrstats](http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/72157623630152423) by [visp](http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/by/vispillo), simply authenticate the app and it gets you files for you, analyses them, and presents them in a lovely graph. Visp has also put together a [demo video](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vispillo/4611408243/) of it in action.

So if you are a Flickr Pro member, it's well worth using this app before the 01-Jun.
