title: Why do so many people still buy road bikes with drop bars but never ride in the dropped position?

I just kind of stumbled across this massive thread from 2009 in rec.bicycles.tech, but it is interesting to me since I'm fairly new to drops (ok, I had a racer as a kid, but it's been well over a 20 year gap since using them). The whole reason I fitted drop handlebars to my current bike was so that I could ride in the drops most of the time. What is the point otherwise? Might as well have bullhorns. I don't have my handlebars way below my seat height though. That way I can get down into the drops and stay there for the headwinds and be comfortable at the same time. Mind you, I don't really have brake hoods (since my brakes are on the cross bar) so perhaps that's why I don't ride in the 'hoods' position so much.
