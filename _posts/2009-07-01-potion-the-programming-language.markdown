So this is what has been keeping [Why](http://whytheluckystiff.net/) busy. Suppose it stands to reason he'd finally write his own language.

I wonder whether this will become the basis of [Shoes](http://shoooes.net/)? I gather he wrote Shoes as a basis for [Hackety Hack](http://hacketyhack.net/) after not being able to get XUL to do what he wanted. Perhaps he's gone one step further and done the language as well? Or it could just be done for fun.
