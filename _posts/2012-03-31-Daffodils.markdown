From last weekend, I think - I lose track of time. There are many more daffodils in bloom now down the track, which would have made for an even prettier picture, but the weather isn't as nice this weekend so I'm glad I got it when I did. Regarding that track: this was taken pretty close to the top of the track and you can just about make out the end of it in the distance. I cleared all of that of ice (big thick slabs) last winter with just a shovel. Just feel like I should point that out as often as I can.
