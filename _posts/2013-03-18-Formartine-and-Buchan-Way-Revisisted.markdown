I thought I'd give it another go since I had seen from the road it had been resurfaced (I use that term loosely; also handily describes the type of surface) since [last time]({% post_url 2011-11-04-formartine-and-buchan-way %}), which I guess must have happened sometime last summer. The bits that are now gravel are pretty speedy, this must be mostly due to it being very flat (since it's the route of an old railway line) and my fixed gear with 60 gear inch set-up feels right at home. Also, no longer is a full suspension mountain bike a requirement. Unfortunately though, for this track to be any use to me in getting home, I have to venture along a less well used section of it and it seems the money for resurfacing ran out at this point - here it is still just a mix of mud and rubble.  It would be awesome if the whole thing was tarmac.
