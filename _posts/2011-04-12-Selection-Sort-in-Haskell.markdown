For me there is just no such thing as spare time any more - it's basically time when I should be doing something else. So when [this popped up](http://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/05/19/another-challenge-can-you-write-a-correct-selection-sort/) I thought it would be an ideal time to learn a bit of Haskell. I had a quick play at the time and had the "Oh! Haskell doesn't have mutable variables!" revelation (although I didn't know they were called mutable back then) had a bit more of a play with recursion, etc and then got busy with other stuff for, well, almost a year(!) until I 'found' time again:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/914610.js?file=selection_sort.hs"></script>

I gather the benefit of Haskell is that this can actually be written in a couple  of lines. Maybe in another eleven months time I'll have figured that out.
