I've had a glimpse of something I now wish I didn't know existed. I'm unsettled at best. On paper it [read as interesting](http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2011/05/tyler-the-creator-goblin/). And I'd certainly seen the name [pop-up in other places](http://www.guardian.co.uk/search?q=Odd+Future&section=music). 

Perhaps it's just my age, but I do not get it at all. I'll stick to [MisterE](http://misterehiphop.bandcamp.com/) thanks.
