<p>I hadn't realised that the recent showing of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0298130">The Ring</a> at <a href="http://www.uci-cinemas.co.uk/2000/whatson/cinemas/uci28/index.html">my local cinema</a> was prompted by the recent release of a <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0298130">remake</a>.  I can't vouch for the remake, but the original Ring series (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0298130">Ring</a>, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0218553">Ring2</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0235712">Ring-0</a>) in Japanese are superb and well scary.  I think the fact that you have to read the sub-titles and thus cannot look away from the screen really help.  I can't imagine a <a href="http://www.dreamworks.com/thering/">hollywood-ised version</a> being as good, but the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/CommentsShow?0298130"> reviews</a> aren't too bad.  Maybe I'll go and see it.</p>
