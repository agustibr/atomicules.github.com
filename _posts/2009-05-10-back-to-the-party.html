<p>A few years ago now I first <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020929131250/http://www.i5m.co.uk/">got on the net</a> (Isn't it scary how much of this stuff hangs around?). I accumulated a lot of posts about a lot of nonsense. I was using <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> as a back end to manage 'dynamic' content, serving it up via server side includes. All in  xhtml goodness. I made a beginners mistake and let my webhost register my domain name in their name. So when they went down the swaney so did my domain name. I <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://i5m.me.uk">relaunched</a> using <a href="http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/">Nanoblogger</a> and served it all up statically on (what was) <a href="http://www.me.com">dotmac</a>. That was fun for awhile until I couldn't justify paying for any kind of hosting for what is a poxy personal website. So I decided to roll my own,  hosting at home using <a href="http://www.everydns.com/">everydns</a>, <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">mongrel</a> and a custom site built in  <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> that used html5 instead of xhtml. A lot of fun, but hosting at home on a laptop(!) is a bit silly really.</p>
<p>So we get to today. Which must make this the 5th or 6th re-incarnation. And I've decided to have a go with tumblr. The price is great: free. It is fairly customisable, and you can use your own domain name; You can pretty much give the appearance you are hosting yourself.</p>
<p>Only, thing is. I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to write here.</p>
