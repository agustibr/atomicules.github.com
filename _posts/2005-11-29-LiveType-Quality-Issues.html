<p>

After a few months I finally had one of those "A ha!" moments when everything

falls into place (I hope).

</p>



<p>

I&apos;ve wondered why there are frequently posts on Apple Discussions and other forums regarding "Livetype Quality",

etc, yet others don&apos;t have these problems? Was it a subjective thing, user error or other?

</p>





<p>

Often the user is referring to the quality of the display in the Canvas in

FCE/FCP. Responses are often along the lines of:

<q>

"The Canvas and computer

monitor are not capable of displaying the same quality as a TV Monitor can,

etc and you should always check output on a TV Monitor"

</q>, etc.

<br />

This makes sense since a TV Monitor is interlaced and (I think) the canvas

drops a field in it&apos;s display (at least when not set to 100%)

<br />

However, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the real problem some of these people are

having. It&apos;s all down to the codec.

<br />

I bet these users are working in the DV codec which unfortuntely just can&apos;t

do what Livetype is capable of in the Animation codec.

<br />

Unfortuantely, those replying are probably pros and are working in better

codecs than DV, such as uncompressed 8-bit, etc and therefore the

degradation isn&apos;t as great for them. They aren&apos;t having the issue due to

this.

<br />

So I think in most cases the

issues with Livetype/Motion Quality are nothing to do with the user mis-interpreting what the Canvas

displays over a TV monitor, but to do with the user working with DV.

<p>Further to that <cite>Kevin Monahan</cite> made <a href="http://www.kenstone.net/cgi/discussions/general.cgi?noframes;read=60455#60455" >an excellent post</a> over at Kenstone&apos;s site:</p>

<p>

Are you working on DV? Were you aware that it is a highly compressed format

at 5:1? There is usually only so much quality you can get out of the DV

Codec

<ul>

<li>Are you monitoring your graphics properly as you work on a decent pro video

monitor?

</li>

<li>Have you checked the dark green "FULL" bar in the Sequence>Render menus

before rendering?

</li>

	<li>Have you enabled the RT Pop up menu to "Safe RT" and Full Quality?</li>

	<li>Is your Motion Filtering Quality set to "Best" in your User Prefs &gt; Render Control?</li>

	<li>Is your Render Quality set to 100%?</li>

	<li>Are your graphics placed on whole, even X, Y integers?</li>

	<li>Are you placing the Wireframes in different positions rather than moving the point controls in the Controls Tab?</li>

	<li>Are you using the poorer quality "legacy" FCP title generators? (You should be using Title 3D instead).</li>

	<li>Do you know how to properly prepare graphics in Photoshop?</li>

</ul>
