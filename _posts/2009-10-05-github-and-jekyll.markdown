The geek side of me is really tempted to desert Tumblr and move to [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll). Reminds me of the time I used [Nanoblogger](http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/).  

I wasn't sure about what could be acheived using Jekyll - most of the [sites](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/sites) I looked at are quite simple, but then I found this one which is a really [nice implementation on Jekyll](http://www.paperplanes.de/), so the only thing holding me back is time - And it's not like I have a stack of spare time on my hands, so the ease of use of Tumblr is likely to win out for the time being.
