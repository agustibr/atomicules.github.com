I like the idea of having a theme to a blog and thought custard and cycling would go hand in hand (humour me) and was honestly intending to post some custard related stuff; perhaps pictures of the sumptuous puddings we've been having of late. But the problem is, as soon as they are made they are eaten - I do not have the patience to get a camera and grab a shot. 

All in all, winter cycling sucks. Ok, a slightly less sweaty back is a nice plus, but I am - so far - enjoying this winter due wholly to the puddings: 

We've had three rhubarb and one plum crumble from the fruit of the garden. Two gooey chocolate puddings. All with custard - of course! 

No pics. You'll just have to imagine how yummy they are.
