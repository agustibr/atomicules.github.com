<p>Oh well, didn&apos;t even even make the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/calc/radio1/competition_runner_up.shtml">runners up in the BBC VJing competition</a>. Haven&apos;t had time to check out those entries yet, but didn&apos;t think <a href="/art/2005/12/01/BBC-Superstar-VJing-Competition">mine was that bad</a> compared to the winners. Luckily I wasn&apos;t depending on a VJing break through to end my engineering career!
