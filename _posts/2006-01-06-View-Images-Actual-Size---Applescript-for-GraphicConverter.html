<p>I really like Gimp since it allows you to set the Monitor Resolution that you are working on. OSX, etc assumes a screen resolution of 72 ppi when viewing images at Actual/Original size. More often than not this isn't the case. For instance on my 12&quot; powerbook the screen is 9.68&quot; x 7.26&quot;. At a resolution of 1024x768 pixels this gives: 1024 / 9.68 = 105.8 ppi. No where near the assumed 72 ppi.</p>

<p>It can be really handy to have an image on screen at the actual size it will print. For me it was printing a picture the correct size to fit into a picture frame for a Doll&apos;s House (it&apos;s not my Doll&apos;s House, it&apos;s Mimi&apos;s; but I do play with it - I have to!). It was handy to hold the frame over my display and see that the image was going to come out the right size</p>

<p>To me this seems pretty fundamental stuff and I&apos;m surprised Apple don&apos;t include this scaling automatically. Since they control software and hardware it should be relatively easy to do, or at least include a system wide user defined option</p>

<p>Anyway, next is figuring out a way to do the same in Preview.app</p>
