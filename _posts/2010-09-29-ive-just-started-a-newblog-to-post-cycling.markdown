I've just started a newblog to post [cycling related stuff](http://custardycling.co.uk) to (I briefly thought about re-inventing this blog again due to the recent lapse in anything even remotely related to art or code, but decided against it) and so spent a bit of time setting up a tumblr theme (using this one as a template). I did all the development in Chrome and just assumed that nowadays if it worked in Chrome it would just look the same in Firefox and Opera, etc (and I don't give a crap about IE).

But it seems that isn't the case. It looks pants in Gecko 1.9 ,and in Gecko 2.0 doesn't get the rounded corners even though I thought [Gecko 2.0 now supported the CSS3 selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/-moz-border-radius) instead of the `-moz` prefixed ones. If I use the `-moz` prefixes I can get the site looking as intended in Firefox 4. I think I might just leave it like that. Haven't figured out why the header and footer colours don't show in Gecko 1.9 - it really is quite a simple layout, nothing fancy.
