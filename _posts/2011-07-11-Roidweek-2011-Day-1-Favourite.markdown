Roidweek 2011 is off to a start! And due, once again, to reasons that don't make any sense whatsoever I cannot take part, but I am still keeping an eye on the group pool and thought it would be cool to blog some of the photos. But it is tricky to find many that are Creative Common licensed. So from day one, I'd say this is my fav (CC licensed), with [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/angies/5926618513/)a close second.
