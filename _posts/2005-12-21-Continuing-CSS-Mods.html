<p>A few more recent tweaks to get my inline images sorted. You'll probably not notice. Still not perfect, but I'm happier now my images aren't sticking out of by blog posts. Not that there are many images; I really should start putting some more in. </p>

<p>Main things I had to do were to .byline (the bit at the bottom of my posts with my name and date) a block so clear it so it would always sit below any images. Of course, then I had to tweak the margins a bit (well, remove them). Any inline images are still simply floated left or right. Still a bit of an issue with images not floating completely cleanly depending on where in the source they occur. I don' quite get it, but it's not a biggy</p>
