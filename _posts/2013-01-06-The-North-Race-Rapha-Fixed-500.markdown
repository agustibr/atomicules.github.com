I'd not heard of this before it came up on the North Race website (but that is probably because I don't bother with the mainstream cycling websites - I'm just not that into lycra). Personally, I enjoyed my time off cycling over Christmas, but it does sound like a nice challenge. However, I'm pretty sure you have to be young, free and single to cycle 500km inbetween Christmas and New Year; I managed just 35km in my two errand-run trips to the shops. 

I wouldn't do [that much damage to my knee](http://thenorthrace.co.uk/2012/12/the-rapha-fixed-500-seeing-it-through/) though, I need them too much.
