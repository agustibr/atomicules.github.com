Well... not really... at all, seeing as how I shot some of these films thirty two months ago, but I have **finally** sent them off and **finally** cleared my backlog of film from 2010. I decided that enough was enough (I've done my bit!) and before asking questions of myself or others I'd just get them sent off at first opportunity this month. And so even if that proves to be a financial error (although really, the cost for these last six films works out at something like 20p per film per month - a pittance) this month, tough! The deed is done.

Now I just have to wait for the results.
