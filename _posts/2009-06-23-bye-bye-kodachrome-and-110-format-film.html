<p>So <a href="http://homepage.1000words.kodak.com/default.asp?item=2388083">Kodachrome is being discontinued</a> after 74 years. I haven't even got around to shooting any yet. I expect there will be a rush on stocks, but for the time being it is <a href="http://www.7dayshop.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=6175">still available</a> (7dayshop). However, in my quick search to find who's stocking it, I then stumble across the shocker that <a href="http://discountfilmsdirect.co.uk/shop/acatalog/Fuji_Superia_110_Cartridge_Film.html">110 film is no longer being made</a> by Fuji (discountfilmsdirect). Gutted.</p>&#13;
<p>So next payday I guess I'm going to have to get a roll of Kodachrome and a roll of 110 film. I've not even got a 110 camera yet. I'd put camera purchases on the back burner after getting my Yashica Mat; after-all I've only been able to afford to put one roll through that so far. But I guess I'm going to have to get a 110 camera sometime this year, I'm pretty sure the 110 stocks will disappear as quickly as 126 did.</p>&#13;
<p>And one day yet, I'm going to have to get my Disc Camera working.</p>&#13;
<p>This is well worth a look: <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=15398&amp;pq-locale=en_GB&amp;_requestid=6633">Kodak's Kodachrome Slide Show</a></p>
