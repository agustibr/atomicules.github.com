<p>I&apos;ve taken the leap and I&apos;m ditching dotmac for a proper webhost and saving a bit of cash to boot! The <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/heywood_si/i5m">http://homepage.mac.com/heywood_si/i5m</a> address will no longer be valid after 13-Oct-2006. Just use the proper <a href="http://www.i5m.me.uk">www.i5m.me.uk</a> one which should ultimately always get to the right place</p>
