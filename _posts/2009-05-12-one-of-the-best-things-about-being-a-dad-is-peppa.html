<p>One of the best things about being a dad is Peppa Pig. Peppa Pig is cool. The episodes are short, sweet and funny, and lovely to look at. Daddy Pig is a role model up there with Homer Simpson. I.e. he's a little bit useless, but remains completely unfazed about any ribbing his family gives him and deals with life's mishaps in the best possible way: by lying on the floor and having a good laugh about them.</p>&#13;
<p>I like Peppa Pig.</p>&#13;
<p>So, how cool was it to see these <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timbfrost/sets/72157617785477346/">Peppa Pig sketches</a> from a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timbfrost/">Tim Frost</a>, an ex-designer on Peppa Pig, in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/peppapig/pool/">Peppa Pig pool</a> on Flickr?</p>&#13;
