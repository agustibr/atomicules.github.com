[The Commons](http://www.flickr.com/commons/) is arguably the best feature of Flickr and at the sametime (still?) the most underated (at least it feels that way to me). [Indicommons](http://www.indicommons.org) is a site that was set-up by fans of The Commons to do their best to address this underated-ness and promote The Commons to the world.

Although I follow the RSS feed for Indicommons and have a [couple](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalarchives/) of [institutions](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nationalgalleries/) as contacts on Flickr, I still don't pay as much attention to it as I would like to, or indeed, should. 

This app is not new news (unless you are me) as it's been around since last August, but I'm hoping it helps me give The Commons and Indicommons the attention they deserve.
