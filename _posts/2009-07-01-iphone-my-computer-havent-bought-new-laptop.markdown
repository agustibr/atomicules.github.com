This is my thought exactly -  although for me my main computing platform is a poor man's iPhone, the iPod Touch (best Â£2 I ever spent) - and what I alluded to in my earlier [JavaScript benchmarking post](http://i-5-m.net/post/130464050/ipod-touch-vs-a-mac-vs-a-pc-sunspider-javascript). It certainly beats a [netbook](http://www.joeydevilla.com/2009/05/26/fast-food-apple-pies-and-why-netbooks-suck/).

Ironically, Tumblr is a bit over-zealous in its iPhone optimisation and I'll have to finish off formatting this post on my mac!
