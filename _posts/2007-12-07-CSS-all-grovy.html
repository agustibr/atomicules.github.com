<p>I've finally fixed the niggling CSS (not <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?q=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cansei_de_Ser_Sexy">CSS</a>) issue I've had at the bottom of the page since this version of the site launched.</p><p>Due to fitting in my rubbish logo (chopped off edges and all, but it was done in five seconds) all the divs, etc are shifted down to accommodate it. This works fine all the way down to the bottom of the page until the "elsewhere on the web bit" which overlapped the footer. It annoyed me so much I ignored trying to fix it for months.</p><p>I'm chuffed. Gonna have a beer to celebrate. Works fine in Gecko and Webkit/KHTML. Internet explorer? Who gives a shit.</p><p>To fix it took one line of CSS. Just adding a bottom margin to the "elsewhere..." div. Gah!</p>
