I had a clever idea to use my [flash with my Yashica](http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/4203775004/), and use a low iso film so I could shoot wide open ([My flash](http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/2095293478/) is only basic so aperture is determined by film speed). Unfortunately it all went a bit [wrong](http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/4357119233/). It seems I over diffused my flash, making it as effective as a candle. This photo is the best recovered.

I did not have a brilliant Christmas for Photograpy: My Praktica 35mm shutter broke, but in a clever way so that it took me four rolls of film to realise. Aaargh!
