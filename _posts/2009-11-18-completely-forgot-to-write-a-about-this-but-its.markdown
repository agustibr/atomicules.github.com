Completely forgot to write a about this, but it's worthy of a blog post as well as being on Flickr. 

Earlier this year I got a [new camera](http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/3082690617/in/set-72157613490405613/) to play with and remarked that it was a shame that I could only get ISO 200 film for it in the UK. [Some kind stranger](http://www.flickr.com/photos/22872498@N02/) in the US offered to ship me a roll of ISO 400 film for free. I accepted the offer. They shipped the film. It arrived. And much time passed, but finally I shot the whole thing and got it developed.

There's no "and I shot the best photo I've ever done" ending to this story, rather my results were mediocre, but the whole story (I sent them some prints as a thank-you) makes me smile and is definitely a highlight of the year.
