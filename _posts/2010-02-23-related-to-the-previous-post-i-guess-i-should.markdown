Related to the previous post, I guess I should mention the rest of [my Kodachrome shots](http://www.flickr.com/photos/i-5-m/sets/72157623338750353/). With the demise of Kodachrome I knew I had to shoot one roll before it was gone for good, and realistically I knew I'd have to limit myself to just one roll. So I was determined to make it a good one. 

I would have liked to have got it scanned sooner, but I have to try and spread out the film costs through the year. With the hiccups I had with my Praktica and Yashica over Christmas I was feeling pretty fed-up with my photography so I decided now was the right time to get the Kodachrome scanned as I knew that would cheer me up.
