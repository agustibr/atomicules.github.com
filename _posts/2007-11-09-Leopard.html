<p>A bit of downtime as I upgraded to OSX 10.5 Leopard. It is very nice and shiny. It also comes with rails pre-installed, which is good.</p><p>Unfortunately that confused me a touch as how to get my site back up and running. I wasn&apos;t sure about mysql, but the 10.4 package works fine. Also the default rails install works, but I&apos;ve heard worrying things about installing gems so I&apos;ve just installed the ones I need manually in the Rails Vendor location. Woohoo, I&apos;m back-up - although I&apos;ll have to check the Leopard firewall isn&apos;t interferring.</p>
